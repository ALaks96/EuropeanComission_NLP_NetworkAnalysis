Master studies are intended to help students acquire advanced knowledge of a specialised or multidisciplinary nature, often geared towards an academic or professional specialisation, as well as promoting an introduction to research work. This MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence is aimed to be within this latter scenario.

The objective of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence is: To prepare students for innovation in the area of Artificial Intelligence, in two ways: firstly, the creation of innovative techniques and methods within the research area of Artificial Intelligence and, secondly, the application of these techniques and methods relative to social and business reality as well as creating processes and innovative computer solutions.

Consequently a higher degree of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence will be afforded and provided to Computer Engineering and Science and Technology professionals studying this course. This will enable them to deal with and solve problems of both a scientific and technological nature using techniques and methods resulting from recent research.

This general objective can be completed using two additional and intrinsic goals. Firstly, the idea of innovating in order to research and, simultaneously, the idea of researching in order to innovate. The first goal suggests innovative programmes, which are able to combine the specialised nature of the degree with creativity that underlies original and productive research directions. The second one is about the ability to be creative when addressing and solving problems through research.

Therefore, the global objective is materialised in more specific objectives that are the following:

Objective 1: Acquire advance training of a specialised and multidisciplinary nature, geared towards  promoting the introduction to research work in Artificial Intelligence.

Objective 2: Provide a higher degree of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence techniques and methods, to be able to deal with and solve technological and scientific problems through the research (research in order to innovate).

Objective 3: Create innovative programmes that are able to combine the specialised nature of the degree with creativity that underlies original, active and productive research directions (innovate in order to research) in Artificial Intelligence.

Objective 4: Enable students to be creative in addressing and solving scientific and technological problems through research in Artificial Intelligence.

 

Competencies
The mentioned objectives are designed to enable students to acquire, during their studies, a set of general and specific competencies.

The competencies of the MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence have been structured into three categories.

The general competencies are included in the first category. These are common to any Master degree in Spain – by Royal Decree –, or are proposed by the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, or are included in the standard EURO-INF, which defines the required competencies for a degree to be accredited as an MSc in Computer Science.
In the second category of competencies are those concerning the research orientation of the degree proposed or shared by any research-oriented Master offered by the School of Computer Science, and that are different from those shared by the professionally-oriented Masters.
And finally, in the third category will be the specific competences in Artificial Intelligence​ that differentiate the proposed Master degree from other research Masters in the School of Computer Science.
This link shows these three set of competencies which, as mentioned above, the students should have acquired after graduation.

According to the above, the graduate of the degree will be in a position to either join the labour force as a specialist in Artificial Intelligence, or to continue their academic training and study for a PhD in the subject. Accordingly, the graduate will acquire an advanced knowledge of a specialised nature in Artificial Intelligence. This course is also multidisciplinary due to the nature of the techniques and methods of Artificial Intelligence being studied. This allows the graduate to perform, as a professional, specific problem solving tasks incorporating these techniques and methods, which constitute recent results of research in the area. At the same time, due to the state-of-the-art nature of the acquired knowledge, and also due to the acquired ability to innovate, the graduate will be in a position to get started in research and consider enrolling in PhD studies."

makers in the use of data and models to solve unstructured problems.

one. For this decision making, the experience, common sense or intuitions of experts
are not enough since often multiple conflicting criteria usually exist including,
uncertainty, several decision makers and various stages. The endless versatility of
real-world human decision problems has triggered necessary efforts in multiple areas

Spain,Universidad Politécnica Madrid,Artificial Intelligence,Bayesian Networks,"This module presents Bayesian Networks as graphic tools which are well consolidated and of wide use nowadays to model uncertainty and reason with in intelligent systems. Uncertainty is modelled with probabilities and reasoning is based on Bayes’ rule. It begins by explaining the meaning of the networks to model reasoning with uncertainty, both casual and non-casual, and both from a structural (qualitative) point of view and parametric (quantitative). The next step is to pose questions to the network, in other words, to infer knowledge from observations or data that is being collected. Thus, we can ask, for instance, for the diagnosis of a disease or the most likely explanation for the observed evidence. The algorithms can obtain the exact or an approximate answer, in the latter case probably using Monte Carlo simulation. The network is built by analysing the problem with an expert, but can also be induced from a database. This is a current issue: how to obtain a structure and parameters for the network and for that machine learning methods will be discussed. Finally, by knowing how to build the network and how to use it to perform queries, it will be possible to see its application on decision making and other applications of great interest within Artificial Intelligence: computer vision, automatic classification, filtering of email, etc.","The objective of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence is preparing students for innovation in the area of Artificial Intelligence in two ways: the creation of innovative techniques and methods in their own research area of Artificial Intelligence and the incorporation of these techniques and methods to the social and business processes and creating innovative software solutions.
Thus, it will give professionals in Computer Science and, in general, professionals of Science and Technology, a greater degree of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, to be able to address and solve scientific and technological problems using methods, techniques and products through recent research in the area. This general objective can be completed with two additional goals and intrinsic to the content of the degree. First, the idea of innovating to investigate and, simultaneously, the idea of research to innovate.The first goal suggests innovative programs that are able to combine the specialized nature of creativity training with underlying original lines, active and productive research.The second is directed toward the ability to be creative in tackling and solving problems through research.Objectives and competencies
Master studies are intended to help students acquire advanced knowledge of a specialised or multidisciplinary nature, often geared towards an academic or professional specialisation, as well as promoting an introduction to research work. This MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence is aimed to be within this latter scenario.

The objective of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence is: To prepare students for innovation in the area of Artificial Intelligence, in two ways: firstly, the creation of innovative techniques and methods within the research area of Artificial Intelligence and, secondly, the application of these techniques and methods relative to social and business reality as well as creating processes and innovative computer solutions.

Consequently a higher degree of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence will be afforded and provided to Computer Engineering and Science and Technology professionals studying this course. This will enable them to deal with and solve problems of both a scientific and technological nature using techniques and methods resulting from recent research.

This general objective can be completed using two additional and intrinsic goals. Firstly, the idea of innovating in order to research and, simultaneously, the idea of researching in order to innovate. The first goal suggests innovative programmes, which are able to combine the specialised nature of the degree with creativity that underlies original and productive research directions. The second one is about the ability to be creative when addressing and solving problems through research.

Therefore, the global objective is materialised in more specific objectives that are the following:

Objective 1: Acquire advance training of a specialised and multidisciplinary nature, geared towards  promoting the introduction to research work in Artificial Intelligence.

Objective 2: Provide a higher degree of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence techniques and methods, to be able to deal with and solve technological and scientific problems through the research (research in order to innovate).

Objective 3: Create innovative programmes that are able to combine the specialised nature of the degree with creativity that underlies original, active and productive research directions (innovate in order to research) in Artificial Intelligence.

Objective 4: Enable students to be creative in addressing and solving scientific and technological problems through research in Artificial Intelligence.

 

Competencies
The mentioned objectives are designed to enable students to acquire, during their studies, a set of general and specific competencies.

The competencies of the MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence have been structured into three categories.

The general competencies are included in the first category. These are common to any Master degree in Spain – by Royal Decree –, or are proposed by the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, or are included in the standard EURO-INF, which defines the required competencies for a degree to be accredited as an MSc in Computer Science.
In the second category of competencies are those concerning the research orientation of the degree proposed or shared by any research-oriented Master offered by the School of Computer Science, and that are different from those shared by the professionally-oriented Masters.
And finally, in the third category will be the specific competences in Artificial Intelligence​ that differentiate the proposed Master degree from other research Masters in the School of Computer Science.
This link shows these three set of competencies which, as mentioned above, the students should have acquired after graduation.

According to the above, the graduate of the degree will be in a position to either join the labour force as a specialist in Artificial Intelligence, or to continue their academic training and study for a PhD in the subject. Accordingly, the graduate will acquire an advanced knowledge of a specialised nature in Artificial Intelligence. This course is also multidisciplinary due to the nature of the techniques and methods of Artificial Intelligence being studied. This allows the graduate to perform, as a professional, specific problem solving tasks incorporating these techniques and methods, which constitute recent results of research in the area. At the same time, due to the state-of-the-art nature of the acquired knowledge, and also due to the acquired ability to innovate, the graduate will be in a position to get started in research and consider enrolling in PhD studies."
Spain,Universidad Politécnica Madrid,Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning,"The seminar provides students with general knowledge about the topic of Machine
Learning, being itself an introduction to the various modules and seminars that are
part of the subject: Bayesian Networks, Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Machine Learning deals with building computer systems that optimise performance
criteria using previous data or experience. A situation where learning is required is
when there is no human experience or it is not easily explained. Another is when the
problem to be solved changes over time or depends on a particular environment.
Machine Learning transforms data into knowledge and provides general purpose
systems that adapt to circumstances. Among the many successful applications that
can be cited are: speech recognition or handwritten text, autonomous robot
navigation, document information retrieval, cooperative filtering, diagnostic systems,
DNA microarrays analysis, etc.
This module presents several methods based on different fields such as Statistics,
Pattern Recognition, Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining. The aim is to know these
methods from a unified perspective, noting which problems can be solved, as well as
the limitations and circumstances of using each one of them.","The objective of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence is preparing students for innovation in the area of Artificial Intelligence in two ways: the creation of innovative techniques and methods in their own research area of Artificial Intelligence and the incorporation of these techniques and methods to the social and business processes and creating innovative software solutions.

Spain,Universidad Politécnica Madrid,Artificial Intelligence,Deep Learning ,"The discipline of machine learning in artificial intelligence provides useful solutions to be used, for example, in data science or in the development of autonomous systems (e.g., robots or unmanned vehicles). With the arrival of big data and the increase of computational power (e.g., parallelization using graphics processing units - GPUs), the approach of deep learning has emerged from the connectionist branch of machine learning with new architectures, algorithms and hybridations with other techniques such as evolutionary algorithms. Deep learning has proved to be significantly better than other approaches to solve problems that cope with large amounts of data as it is required, for example, in computer vision (image or video processing), in speech understanding, or in classification, besides other problems. This seminar presents a theoretical and practical view of deep learning. The seminar presents first the foundations of artificial neural networks with both supervised and unsupervised learning. Then, the seminar presents different types of deep architectures (e.g., convolutional neural networks, etc.) and application domains (e.g., computer vision). To complement the practical view, the seminar also presents specialized software tools for deep learning and describes how to use them in practical problems.","The objective of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence is preparing students for innovation in the area of Artificial Intelligence in two ways: the creation of innovative techniques and methods in their own research area of Artificial Intelligence and the incorporation of these techniques and methods to the social and business processes and creating innovative software solutions.

Spain,Universidad Politécnica Madrid,Artificial Intelligence,Natural Language Processing,"The purpose of this seminar derives from the need to fill a gap in the teaching of subjects that are, generally speaking, on Language Engineering. On the one hand, when we talk about Engineering, then we talk about design, methodologies, techniques, systems, and components; on the other hand, when we talk about language then we talk about grammars, corpora, dictionaries, etc. Usually, the teaching of these subjects often has a tendency, perhaps excessive, to one side or another. This seminar aims to provide a unified view of both sides, from the fundamentals to applications. The area of Linguistic Engineering is considered to be one of the areas where most research and development efforts will lie in the next few years, if we are to achieve the goal of having machines that really make our lives easier in a simple way.

Spain,Universidad Politécnica Madrid,Artificial Intelligence,Automated Planning,"Automated planning is a branch of Artificial intelligence aimed at obtaining plans (i.e. sequences of actions) for solving complex problems or for governing the behavior of intelligent agents, autonomous robots or unmanned vehicles. Planning techniques have been successfully applied in different domains, including industrial contexts, logistics, computer games, robotics or space exploration. In this seminar we will review the existing approaches for solving classical planning problems, such as state-space search, plan-space search, graph-based techniques or turning classical planning problems into propositional satisfiability problems. The course will then focus on the study of knowledge-based planning methods, such as control rule-based pruning or hierarchical task network-based planning techniques. These approaches exploit the domain knowledge provided by human experts to improve the performance of the planning algorithms. Finally, we will briefly introduce advanced planning algorithms, which are able to generate planning policies that take into account time constraints and/or partial observability conditions, which are common in real world applications.","The objective of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence is preparing students for innovation in the area of Artificial Intelligence in two ways: the creation of innovative techniques and methods in their own research area of Artificial Intelligence and the incorporation of these techniques and methods to the social and business processes and creating innovative software solutions.
Thus, it will give professionals in Computer Science and, in general, professionals of Science and Technology, a greater degree of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, to be able to address and solve scientific and technological problems using methods, techniques and products through recent research in the area. This general objective can be completed with two additional goals and intrinsic to the content of the degree. First, the idea of innovating to investigate and, simultaneously, the idea of research to innovate.The first goal suggests innovative programs that are able to combine the specialized nature of creativity training with underlying original lines, active and productive research.The second is directed toward the ability to be creative in tackling and solving problems through research.Objectives and competencies
Master studies are intended to help students acquire advanced knowledge of a specialised or multidisciplinary nature, often geared towards an academic or professional specialisation, as well as promoting an introduction to research work. This MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence is aimed to be within this latter scenario.

The objective of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence is: To prepare students for innovation in the area of Artificial Intelligence, in two ways: firstly, the creation of innovative techniques and methods within the research area of Artificial Intelligence and, secondly, the application of these techniques and methods relative to social and business reality as well as creating processes and innovative computer solutions.

Consequently a higher degree of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence will be afforded and provided to Computer Engineering and Science and Technology professionals studying this course. This will enable them to deal with and solve problems of both a scientific and technological nature using techniques and methods resulting from recent research.

This general objective can be completed using two additional and intrinsic goals. Firstly, the idea of innovating in order to research and, simultaneously, the idea of researching in order to innovate. The first goal suggests innovative programmes, which are able to combine the specialised nature of the degree with creativity that underlies original and productive research directions. The second one is about the ability to be creative when addressing and solving problems through research.

Therefore, the global objective is materialised in more specific objectives that are the following:

Objective 1: Acquire advance training of a specialised and multidisciplinary nature, geared towards  promoting the introduction to research work in Artificial Intelligence.

Objective 2: Provide a higher degree of knowledge in Artificial Intelligence techniques and methods, to be able to deal with and solve technological and scientific problems through the research (research in order to innovate).

Objective 3: Create innovative programmes that are able to combine the specialised nature of the degree with creativity that underlies original, active and productive research directions (innovate in order to research) in Artificial Intelligence.

Objective 4: Enable students to be creative in addressing and solving scientific and technological problems through research in Artificial Intelligence.

Spain,Universidad Politécnica Madrid,Artificial Intelligence,Biomedical Informatics,"Biomedical informatics tries to analyse problems in medical practice from the viewpoint of information management (medical and biological) and find the best solutions by using computers. Therefore, the emphasis is on the handling of data, information and knowledge, and not on the techniques and methods used. Many of the current problems of biomedicine have their root cause in the defects of analysing and managing information, which might have better solutions with proper systems from medical informatics. Technologies are not the ultimate goal of biomedical informatics; however, it is indeed important to use methods that would not only allow building the best applications, but also sharing and reusing skills and knowledge by encouraging collaboration between research groups. These joint efforts are stimulated by the growth of the Internet and new techniques of Artificial Intelligence, database, programming and Software Engineering, which facilitate communication between applications and groups. The use of new technology-based systems (e.g. the Semantic Web or Grid) is contributing to a breakthrough in biomedical informatics.","The objective of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence is preparing students for innovation in the area of Artificial Intelligence in two ways: the creation of innovative techniques and methods in their own research area of Artificial Intelligence and the incorporation of these techniques and methods to the social and business processes and creating innovative software solutions.

Portugal,Técnico Lisbo,Data Science ,Information Visualization,"The main goal is to provide students with knowledge in the área of Information Visualization, that allows them to design and develop high-impact visualizations of data and information, to effectively transmit qualitative and quantitative data. The area of Information Visualization will be introduced, after which we’ll teach a methodology for analyzing problema domains and conceiving effective visualizations. Afterwards, we'll d’scuss the different kinds of variables (continuous, nominal, ratio, etc.), data (tabular, networks, text, etc.) and patterns to visualize. Next, we’ll describe the different relevant physiological and psychological factors (memory, visual processing, etc.) relevant for the creation of good visualizations. We’ll study the most common kinds of visualizations adequate for different information types (graphs, time series, etc.) and interaction techniques (focus+context, overview+detail, panning+zoom, brushing, etc).

The evaluation of the Data Analysis and Integration course consists of a final exam (55% of the final grade, minimum grade of 9.5) and three small projects developed throughout the semester (45% of final grade, minimum grade of 9.5 in the average of the three projects).

Working students (i.e., students enrolled in recognized professional activities) may choose an evaluation method based only on the exam (100% of the final grade).

After the exam, students whose difference between the project grade (i.e., the average grade for the projects, on a scale between 0 and 20) and the exam grade is higher than 5 values, will have as final grade the lowest between the exam and project grades. Students in this situation may propose themselves to an oral evaluation, to be undertaken at the end of the semester and after the second exam. In this case, the final grade may vary between the lowest between the exam and project grades and the average obtained from the exam and project grades, according to the performance of the student.

Each small project will contain practical problems, for which students must find programmatic solutions (e.g., SQL statements), and theoretical questions. The first project will cover topics 1-3 of the course, the second project will cover topics 4-7 of the course, and the third project will cover topics 8-10.

The evaluation of the Data Administration in Information Systems course consists of a final exam (55% of the final grade, minimum grade of 9.5) and three small projects developed throughout the semester (45% of final grade, minimum grade of 9.5 in the average of the three projects).
Working students (i.e., students enrolled in recognized professional activities) may choose an evaluation method based only on the exam (100% of the final grade).
After the exam, students whose difference between the grade of the project (i.e., the average grade for the projects, on a scale between 0 and 20) and the exam grade is higher than 5 values, will have as final grade the lowest between the exam and project grades. Students in this situation may propose themselves to an oral evaluation, to be undertaken at the end of the semester and after the second exam. In this case, the final grade may vary between the lowest between the exam and project grades and the average obtained from the exam and project grades, according to the performance of the student.
Each small project will contain practical problems, for which students must find programmatic solutions (e.g., SQL statements), and theoretical questions. The first project will cover topics

Germany,Technische Universität München,MSc Mathematics in Data Science,Data Mining,N/A,"The master's degree program Mathematics in Data Science combines a high-profile education in mathematics with an emphasis on the burgeoning area of Big Data.The Master's in ""Mathematics in Data Science"" is a full-time degree program that usually takes two years to complete. Applicants must have a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics or a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (with minor Mathematics) or an equivalent qualification in a similar field of study.

The master's program ""Mathematics in Data Science"" is oriented towards students who want to receive a high-profile education in mathematics with an emphasis on the burgeoning area of Big Data. Graduates of this program are qualified to understand in detail complex techniques for data editing and data analysis, how to adapt complex models to concrete problems, to combine and redevelop them in order to derive prediction and classification models. They are qualified to assess the capabilities and limits of different algorithms and to extend algorithms to solve specific problems.The main focus during the Mathematics in Data Science Master’s program is on the areas of Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Students therefore focus on techniques of data retention and data evaluation. They learn to tailor these procedures to specific problems and to combine or redevelop them, thereby deriving prediction and classification models. In addition, they deal with the development of algorithms for problem-solving purposes. Interdisciplinary courses are equally important elements of the Master’s program. These deal with the social and political implications of big data as well as conveying fundamental legal knowledge and foreign language expertise. Methods and algorithms from Statistics, Machine Learning, Optimization, and the Theory of Data Representation are important mathematical elements of the Mathematics in Data Science Master's program.The Integrative Study Program offers two different
master courses. Students who want to focus on the
mathematical aspects are encouraged to apply for
“Mathematics in Data Science” whereas students who
are interested in the computer science perspective
should apply for “Data Engineering and Analytics”. Data are a key resource in present and future economic developments. Revolutionary insights can be extracted from
data by means of exploration, analyses, and engineering,
and the world is reacting with impressive impulses and
creative ideas. Industry is pushing towards data-guided
decisions, while entrepreneurships flourish with ever new
tidbits of knowledge extracted from data.
In this context, the two TUM master´s programs “Mathematics in Data Science” and “Data Engineering and Analytics” create the unique opportunity for an in-depth study of
data science and data engineering.
Both programs provide the fundamentals in data engineering and data analysis. Advanced modules in “Mathematics
in Data Science” focus on interpretation of data, simulation
and prediction of complex phenomena. “Data Engineering
and Analytics” specializes on techniques for the engineering of systems that  enable the exploration and analysis of vast amounts of data.To enjoy the program and to succeed, your interests and
qualities should meet the following:
• Solid affinity to abstract concepts and their practical
implementation
• Strong desire to apply mathematical concepts to real
world problems
• Ability to communicate ideas from complex subjects to interdisciplinary teams. Data science and data engineering require skills and
knowledge from multiple disciplines. This prompted the
Departments of Mathematics and Informatics at TUM to
jointly create integrative study programs in data science.
Integrative study programs allow the exchange of expertise amongst departments so that the master´s programs
“Mathematics in Data Science” and “Data Engineering and
Analytics” can cover a large spectrum of topics.
Lectures on advanced database technology, distributed
systems, IT security, machine learning, and scalable programming methods are provided by the Department of
Informatics. Statistics, mathematical representation of
large and high-dimensional data sets, their dimensionality
reduction, and their classification to mine meaningful information, cryptography and optimization are taught by the
Department of Mathematics.
The program “Mathematics in Data Science” emphasizes
optimization and statistics, adding basic knowledge to the
computer science aspects. The program “Data Engineering
and Analytics” targets advanced database technology and
scalable programming methods.• The Mathematics and Informatics departments at
TUM offer top level competences. Both departments
jointly operate the data science programs as part of
the TUM Data Science initiative and offer one of first
programs of this type in Germany and Europe.
• International ties to other universities provide the
opportunity for student exchanges and assure the
exchange of competences and top-quality lectures.

Germany,Technische Universität München,MSc Mathematics in Data Science,Data Mining,N/A,"The master's degree program Mathematics in Data Science combines a high-profile education in mathematics with an emphasis on the burgeoning area of Big Data.The Master's in ""Mathematics in Data Science"" is a full-time degree program that usually takes two years to complete. Applicants must have a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics or a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (with minor Mathematics) or an equivalent qualification in a similar field of study.

The master's program ""Mathematics in Data Science"" is oriented towards students who want to receive a high-profile education in mathematics with an emphasis on the burgeoning area of Big Data. Graduates of this program are qualified to understand in detail complex techniques for data editing and data analysis, how to adapt complex models to concrete problems, to combine and redevelop them in order to derive prediction and classification models. They are qualified to assess the capabilities and limits of different algorithms and to extend algorithms to solve specific problems.The main focus during the Mathematics in Data Science Master’s program is on the areas of Data Engineering, Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Students therefore focus on techniques of data retention and data evaluation. They learn to tailor these procedures to specific problems and to combine or redevelop them, thereby deriving prediction and classification models. In addition, they deal with the development of algorithms for problem-solving purposes. Interdisciplinary courses are equally important elements of the Master’s program. These deal with the social and political implications of big data as well as conveying fundamental legal knowledge and foreign language expertise. Methods and algorithms from Statistics, Machine Learning, Optimization, and the Theory of Data Representation are important mathematical elements of the Mathematics in Data Science Master's program.The Integrative Study Program offers two different
master courses. Students who want to focus on the
mathematical aspects are encouraged to apply for
“Mathematics in Data Science” whereas students who
are interested in the computer science perspective
should apply for “Data Engineering and Analytics”. Data are a key resource in present and future economic developments. Revolutionary insights can be extracted from
data by means of exploration, analyses, and engineering,
and the world is reacting with impressive impulses and
creative ideas. Industry is pushing towards data-guided
decisions, while entrepreneurships flourish with ever new
tidbits of knowledge extracted from data.
In this context, the two TUM master´s programs “Mathematics in Data Science” and “Data Engineering and Analytics” create the unique opportunity for an in-depth study of
data science and data engineering.
Both programs provide the fundamentals in data engineering and data analysis. Advanced modules in “Mathematics
in Data Science” focus on interpretation of data, simulation
and prediction of complex phenomena. “Data Engineering
and Analytics” specializes on techniques for the engineering of systems that  enable the exploration and analysis of vast amounts of data.To enjoy the program and to succeed, your interests and
qualities should meet the following:
• Solid affinity to abstract concepts and their practical
implementation
• Strong desire to apply mathematical concepts to real
world problems
• Ability to communicate ideas from complex subjects to interdisciplinary teams. Data science and data engineering require skills and
knowledge from multiple disciplines. This prompted the
Departments of Mathematics and Informatics at TUM to
jointly create integrative study programs in data science.
Integrative study programs allow the exchange of expertise amongst departments so that the master´s programs
“Mathematics in Data Science” and “Data Engineering and
Analytics” can cover a large spectrum of topics.
Lectures on advanced database technology, distributed
systems, IT security, machine learning, and scalable programming methods are provided by the Department of
Informatics. Statistics, mathematical representation of
large and high-dimensional data sets, their dimensionality
reduction, and their classification to mine meaningful information, cryptography and optimization are taught by the
Department of Mathematics.
The program “Mathematics in Data Science” emphasizes
optimization and statistics, adding basic knowledge to the
computer science aspects. The program “Data Engineering
and Analytics” targets advanced database technology and
scalable programming methods.• The Mathematics and Informatics departments at
TUM offer top level competences. Both departments

Germany,Technische Universität München,MSc Data Engineering and Analytics,Foundations in Data Engineering,N/A,"Handling and analyzing very large amounts of data is an urgent problem in many areas of science and industry and requires novel approaches and techniques. The trend towards ""Big Data"" is caused by a host of developments: Firstly, the creation and storage of large data sets becomes feasible and economically viable, for example due to price decreases in storage space, sensors, smart devices, social networks and many more. Secondly, technical advances for example in multi-core systems and cloud computing make it possible to examine data sets at large scale. And thirdly, such amounts of data do not only origin in the ""classical"" domains like business data, but now are created in many areas of life. Consider vehicles, that create sensor data and share information via intelligent networking, or consider data that is created by intelligent energy grids.The master program Data Engineering and Analytics steps up to these developments and provides an education that on the one hand enables graduates to design and plan industry grade solutions in the area of Big Data, on the other hand creates a solid starting point for ventures into research.In parallel to the master program ""Data Engineering and Analytics"", the department of Mathematics is creating the master program ""Mathematics in Data Science"". Both programs share a common core of foundations and focus on the informatics and mathematical aspects of Big Data. The collection, modeling, storage, processing and evaluation of extremely large (e.g. social media), rapidly changing (e.g. sensor data) and complex (e.g. ecological systems) data sets is the aim of both programs. In the Informatics program, emphasis is put on how to provide data, so that is can be efficiently processed with various methods. Data storage and access must be accommodated to the humongous amount of data, the high frequency of change and the high complexity and be able to react variably. Furthermore, it must adjust to changing analytical algorithms and visualization of results. ""Data Engineering and Analytics"" provides a profound knowledge about the fundamental methods and teaches practical techniques for the processing of very large data sets.

In contrast to this, ""Mathematics in Data Science"" focuses on computation, simulation and prediction of complex phenomena (e.g. customer behavior, economical trends and medical data) and on the often times complicated interpretation of this data, which requires complex mathematical models.The program is divided into three areas of study: Data Analysis, Data Engineering and Analytics and Data Engineering. The first area is concerned with fundamentals of understanding and modelling data and the underlying relationships. Data Engineering consists of lectures about the construction of systems that perform efficient and scalable data processing, thus enable the methods of Data Analysis on large data sets.

The curriculum comprises mandatory courses on Data Analysis and Data Engineering. Advanced lectures are offered in these area of studies: Data Engineering contains lectures about distributes systems, distributed databases, query optimization, database systems on modern CPU architectures and high performance computing. Data Engineering and Analytics offers lectures about machine learning, business analytics, computer vision and scientific visualization. Data Analysis is concerned with topics that require solid mathematical foundations: Fundamentals of Convex Optimization, Computational Statistics and more.

For further information please refer to the curriculum overview and the module catalogue.The master program data engineering and analytics is designed for students with a bachelor's degree in Informatics or Mathematics with a minor Informatics (or similar), which aim to specialize in Data Engineering and Analytics. Applicants need to have elementary skills in Informatics, especially foundations of Informatics and programming of algorithms and databases. In the application process, the applicant's transcript of record is matched against a predetermined catalogue. In case there are important core lectures missing, these can be added as mandatory courses to the applicant's curriculum. In case more than 30 ECTS are missing, admission is not possible. Also, proficiency in English is required. Furthermore, students that did not provide proof of proficiency in German before enrollment will receive an obligation to complete at least one module that provides integrative knowledge of the German language. Voluntarily completed extracurricular courses, for example German courses at the TUM language center will be recognized.

Germany,Technische Universität München,MSc Data Engineering and Analytics,Data Analytics,N/A,"Handling and analyzing very large amounts of data is an urgent problem in many areas of science and industry and requires novel approaches and techniques. The trend towards ""Big Data"" is caused by a host of developments: Firstly, the creation and storage of large data sets becomes feasible and economically viable, for example due to price decreases in storage space, sensors, smart devices, social networks and many more. Secondly, technical advances for example in multi-core systems and cloud computing make it possible to examine data sets at large scale. And thirdly, such amounts of data do not only origin in the ""classical"" domains like business data, but now are created in many areas of life. Consider vehicles, that create sensor data and share information via intelligent networking, or consider data that is created by intelligent energy grids.The master program Data Engineering and Analytics steps up to these developments and provides an education that on the one hand enables graduates to design and plan industry grade solutions in the area of Big Data, on the other hand creates a solid starting point for ventures into research.In parallel to the master program ""Data Engineering and Analytics"", the department of Mathematics is creating the master program ""Mathematics in Data Science"". Both programs share a common core of foundations and focus on the informatics and mathematical aspects of Big Data. The collection, modeling, storage, processing and evaluation of extremely large (e.g. social media), rapidly changing (e.g. sensor data) and complex (e.g. ecological systems) data sets is the aim of both programs. In the Informatics program, emphasis is put on how to provide data, so that is can be efficiently processed with various methods. Data storage and access must be accommodated to the humongous amount of data, the high frequency of change and the high complexity and be able to react variably. Furthermore, it must adjust to changing analytical algorithms and visualization of results. ""Data Engineering and Analytics"" provides a profound knowledge about the fundamental methods and teaches practical techniques for the processing of very large data sets.

In contrast to this, ""Mathematics in Data Science"" focuses on computation, simulation and prediction of complex phenomena (e.g. customer behavior, economical trends and medical data) and on the often times complicated interpretation of this data, which requires complex mathematical models.The program is divided into three areas of study: Data Analysis, Data Engineering and Analytics and Data Engineering. The first area is concerned with fundamentals of understanding and modelling data and the underlying relationships. Data Engineering consists of lectures about the construction of systems that perform efficient and scalable data processing, thus enable the methods of Data Analysis on large data sets.

Switzerland,Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich,MSc Data Science,Big Data,"The key challenge of the information society is to turn data into information, information into knowledge, knowledge into value. This has become increasingly complex. Data comes in larger volumes, diverse shapes, from different sources. Data is more heterogeneous and less structured than forty years ago. Nevertheless, it still needs to be processed fast, with support for complex operations.This combination of requirements, together with the technologies that have emerged in order to address them, is typically referred to as ""Big Data."" This revolution has led to a completely new way to do business, e.g., develop new products and business models, but also to do science -- which is sometimes referred to as data-driven science or the ""fourth paradigm"".

Unfortunately, the quantity of data produced and available -- now in the Zettabyte range (that's 21 zeros) per year -- keeps growing faster than our ability to process it. Hence, new architectures and approaches for processing it were and are still needed. Harnessing them must involve a deep understanding of data not only in the large, but also in the small.

The field of databases evolves at a fast pace. In order to be prepared, to the extent possible, to the (r)evolutions that will take place in the next few decades, the emphasis of the lecture will be on the paradigms and core design ideas, while today's technologies will serve as supporting illustrations thereof.

After visiting this lecture, you should have gained an overview and understanding of the Big Data landscape, which is the basis on which one can make informed decisions, i.e., pick and orchestrate the relevant technologies together for addressing each business use case efficiently and consistently.	This course gives an overview of database technologies and of the most important database design principles that lay the foundations of the Big Data universe. The material is organized along three axes: data in the large, data in the small, data in the very small. A broad range of aspects is covered with a focus on how they fit all together in the big picture of the Big Data ecosystem.

- physical storage: distributed file systems (HDFS), object storage(S3), key-value stores

- logical storage: document stores (MongoDB), column stores (HBase), graph databases (neo4j), data warehouses (ROLAP)

- data formats and syntaxes (XML, JSON, RDF, Turtle, CSV, XBRL, YAML, protocol buffers, Avro)

- data shapes and models (tables, trees, graphs, cubes)

To facilitate deeper understanding, an important part of the course will be a group hands-on programming project where students will build a system based on the learned material.        The course covers the following inter-connected directions. 

Part I: Robust and Explainable Deep Learning
-------------------------------------------------------------

Deep learning technology has made impressive advances in recent years. Despite this progress however, the fundamental challenge with deep learning remains that of understanding what a trained neural network has actually learned, and how stable that solution is. Forr example: is the network stable to slight perturbations of the input (e.g., an image)? How easy it is to fool the network into mis-classifying obvious inputs? Can we guide the network in a manner beyond simple labeled data? 

Topics: 
- Attacks: Finding adversarial examples via state-of-the-art attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD attacks).
- Defenses: Automated methods and tools which guarantee robustness of deep nets (e.g., using abstract domains, mixed-integer solvers)
- Combing differentiable logic with gradient-based methods so to train networks to satisfy richer properties.
- Frameworks: AI2, DiffAI, Reluplex, DQL, DeepPoly, etc.

Part II: Program Synthesis/Induction
------------------------------------------------

Synthesis is a new frontier in AI where the computer programs itself via user provided examples. Synthesis has significant applications for non-programmers as well as for programmers where it can provide massive productivity increase (e.g., wrangling for data scientists). Modern synthesis techniques excel at learning functions over discrete spaces from (partial) intent. There have been a number of recent, exciting breakthroughs in techniques that discover complex, interpretable/explainable functions from few examples, partial sketches and other forms of supervision. 

Topics: 
- Theory of program synthesis: version spaces, counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) with SAT/SMT, lower bounds on learning.
- Applications of techniques: synthesis for end users (e.g., spreadsheets) and data analytics.
- Combining synthesis with learning: application to learning from code.
- Frameworks: PHOG, DeepCode.

Part III: Probabilistic Programming
----------------------------------------------

Probabilistic programming is an emerging direction, recently also pushed by various companies (e.g., Facebook, Uber, Google) whose goal is democratize the construction of probabilistic models. In probabilistic programming, the user specifies a model while inference is left to the underlying solver. The idea is that the higher level of abstraction makes it easier to express, understand and reason about probabilistic models. 

Topics: 

- Probabilistic Inference: sampling based, exact symbolic inference, semantics
- Applications of probabilistic programming: bias in deep learning, differential privacy (connects to Part I).
- Frameworks: PSI, Edward2, Venture.","The specialized ETH Master's program in data science, offered in collaboration with the Department of Mathematics as well as the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, provides a high quality education geared towards nurturing the next generation of data scientists.

* Maximum Entropy
* Information Bottleneck
* Deterministic Annealing

# Clustering: The problem of sorting data into groups without using training samples. This requires a definition of ``similarity'' between data points and adequate optimization procedures.

# Model selection: We have already discussed how to fit a model to a data set in ML I, which usually involved adjusting model parameters for a given type of model. Model selection refers to the question of how complex the chosen model should be. As we already know, simple and complex models both have advantages and drawbacks alike.

Switzerland,Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich,MSc Data Science,How To Write Fast Numerical Code,"This course introduces the student to the foundations and state-of-the-art techniques in developing high performance software for numerical functionality such as linear algebra and others. The focus is on optimizing for the memory hierarchy and for special instruction sets. Finally, the course will introduce the recent field of automatic performance tuning.        Software performance (i.e., runtime) arises through the interaction of algorithm, its implementation, and the microarchitecture the program is run on. The first goal of the course is to provide the student with an understanding of this interaction, and hence software performance, focusing on numerical or mathematical functionality. The second goal is to teach a general systematic strategy how to use this knowledge to write fast software for numerical problems. This strategy will be trained in a few homeworks and semester-long group projects.        The fast evolution and increasing complexity of computing platforms pose a major challenge for developers of high performance software for engineering, science, and consumer applications: it becomes increasingly harder to harness the available computing power. Straightforward implementations may lose as much as one or two orders of magnitude in performance. On the other hand, creating optimal implementations requires the developer to have an understanding of algorithms, capabilities and limitations of compilers, and the target platform's architecture and microarchitecture. 

This interdisciplinary course introduces the student to the foundations and state-of-the-art techniques in high performance software development using important functionality such as linear algebra functionality, transforms, filters, and others as examples. The course will explain how to optimize for the memory hierarchy, take advantage of special instruction sets, and, if time permits, how to write multithreaded code for multicore platforms. Much of the material is based on state-of-the-art research. 

Further, a general strategy for performance analysis and optimization is introduced that the students will apply in group projects that accompany the course.

This makes it almost a certainty that the future of computation will rely on parallelism. In this new graduate-level course, we discuss the expanding body of work on the theoretical foundations of modern parallel computation, with an emphasis on the algorithmic tools and techniques for large-scale processing.        This course will familiarize the students with the algorithmic tools and techniques in modern parallel computation. In particular, we will discuss the growing body of algorithmic results in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model. This model is a mathematical abstraction of some of the popular large-scale processing settings such as MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, etc. By the end of the semester, the students will know all the standard tools of this area, as well as the state of the art on a number of the central problems. Our hope is that the course prepares the students for independent research at the frontier of this area, and we will attempt to move in that direction with the course projects. 

The course assumes no particular familiarity with parallel computation and should be accesible to any student with sufficient theoretical/algorithmic background. In particular, we expect that all students are comfortable with the basics of algorithmics designs and analysis, as well as probability theory.        The course will cover a sampling of the recent developments (and open questions) at the frontier of research in massively/modern parallel computation. the material will be based on compilation of recent papers on this area, which will be provided throughout the semester.","The specialized ETH Master's program in data science, offered in collaboration with the Department of Mathematics as well as the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, provides a high quality education geared towards nurturing the next generation of data scientists.

This course provides a gentle introduction to Algebraic methods, illustrated by examples and focusing on basic ideas and connections to other areas.        Combinatorics is a fundamental mathematical discipline as well as an essential component of many mathematical areas, and its study has experienced an impressive growth in recent years. While in the past many of the basic combinatorial results were obtained mainly by ingenuity and detailed reasoning, the modern theory has grown out of this early stage and often relies on deep, well-developed tools.

One of the main general techniques that played a crucial role in the development of Combinatorics was the application of algebraic methods. The most fruitful such tool is the dimension argument. Roughly speaking, the method can be described as follows. In order to bound the cardinality of of a discrete structure A one maps its elements to vectors in a linear space, and shows that the set A is mapped to linearly independent vectors. It then follows that the cardinality of A is bounded by the dimension of the corresponding linear space. This simple idea is surprisingly powerful and has many famous applications.

This course provides a gentle introduction to Algebraic methods, illustrated by examples and focusing on basic ideas and connections to other areas. The topics covered in the class will include (but are not limited to):

Basic dimension arguments, Spaces of polynomials and tensor product methods, Eigenvalues of graphs and their application, the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz and the Chevalley-Warning theorem. Applications such as: Solution of Kakeya problem in finite fields, counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture, chromatic number of the unit distance graph of Euclidean space, explicit constructions of Ramsey graphs and many others.

Stochastic processes are a way to describe and study the behaviour of systems that evolve in some random way.

Switzerland,Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich,MSc Data Science,Estimation and Testing under Sparsity,"In high-dimensional models the number of parameters p is larger than the number of observations n. Therefore, classical (asymptotic) theory needs new methods and paradigms for estimation and testing. One of the key concepts here is ""sparsity"" which says that most of the parameters are actually not relevant and can be set to zero.        In high-dimensional models the number of parameters p is larger than the number of observations n. Therefore, classical (asymptotic) theory needs new methods and paradigms for estimation and testing. One of the key concepts here is ""sparsity"" which says that most of the parameters are actually not relevant and can be set to zero. A popular way to take sparsity into account is regularizing using the l_1-penalty. This leads to two lines of research. Firstly, we need to study the statistical properties of l_1-regularized estimators and related issues, for example their role as initial estimators in a one-step procedure for the construction of asymptotically linear estimators. Secondly, the l_1-approach has a special geometry which one can study in terms of properties of empirical processes. Therefore the lectures have two intertwined parts: one where statistical theory plays the main role and a second where probability theory is studied. Most results presented will be given a full proof, perhaps with parts left as exercises.","The specialized ETH Master's program in data science, offered in collaboration with the Department of Mathematics as well as the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, provides a high quality education geared towards nurturing the next generation of data scientists.

Switzerland,Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich,MSc Data Science,Student Seminar in Statistics,"Statistical inference based on a random sample can be performed under additional shape restrictions on the unknown entity to be estimated (regression curve, probability density, ROC curve...). Under shape restrictions, we mean a variety of constraints. Examples thereof include monotonicity, bounded variation, convexity, k-monotonicity or log-concavity.        The main goal of this Student Seminar is to get acquainted with the existing approaches in shape constrained estimation. The students will get to learn that specific estimation techniques can be used under shape restrictions to obtain better estimators, especially for small/moderate sample sizes. Students will also have the opportunity to learn that one of the main merits of shape constrained inference is to avoid choosing some arbitrary tuning parameter as it is the case with bandwidth selection in kernel estimation methods.

Furthemore, students will get to read about some efficient algorithms that can be used to fastly compute the obtained estimators. One of the famous algoritms is the so-called PAVA (Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm) used under monotonicity to compute a monotone estimator of a regression curve or a probability density.

During the Seminar, the students will have to study some selected chapters from the books ""Statistical Inference under Order Restrictions"" by Barlow, Bartholomew, Bremner and Brunk, and ""Nonparametric estimation under shape constraints"" by Groeneboom and Jongbloed.

Currently, Outbrain pairs relevant content with curious readers in about 250 billion personalized recommendations every month across many thousands of sites. In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to predict which pieces of content its global base of users are likely to click on. Improving Outbrain’s recommendation algorithm will mean more users uncover stories that satisfy their individual tastes.

The dataset for this challenge contains a sample of users’ page views and clicks, as observed on multiple publisher sites in the United States between 14-June-2016 and 28-June-2016. Each viewed page or clicked recommendation is further accompanied by some semantic attributes of those documents.

The data to be analyzed was over 2 billion tuples and  100GB uncompressed.

The entire class participated as a single team, in which each student developed a solution to the problem, which was combined into a single ensemble solution.

Belgium,Universiteit Antwerpen,MSc Data Science,Model Driven Engineering,"You should be able to build a model for a simple application in each of the formalisms discussed. When building these models you pay sufficiently attention to their quality: do they have a clear structure, is the level of abstraction the right one, do they contain sufficient information to express relevant properties.
You are also expected to show that you are able to use the different tools for simulation, verification and transformation for the models produced, and that you can explain the pros and cons of the various models.
The purpose of the course is to introduce you to a few (say, 3) typical modeling languages used in software engineering, and the tools that are based on them. In the model-driven approach to software development, a software system is seen as a cluster of models, on various levels of abstraction and with various characteristics. Each of these models captures certain features or aspects of the systems, allows its own kind of analysis, and has its own tools available. In this way one may apply the many sophisticated tools and theories that have been developed for particular models by the research community. It is clear, however, that this will not work without powerful tools for integrating the various models, transforming them into one another, generating code from them, and keeping them consistent. The course introduces students to this area, concentrating on the use of a concrete, rule based  transformation engine.","During your study at the University of Antwerp, you can live through a wide variety of applications of computer science.

France,Ecole Polytechnique   ,MSc Data Science ,Advanced Machine Learning,"Machine learning is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from data. A major focus of machine learning is to automatically learn complex patterns and to make intelligent decisions based on them. The set of possible data inputs that feed a learning task can be very large and diverse, which makes modelling and prior assumptions critical problems for the design of relevant algorithms.
This course focuses on the methodology underlying supervised and unsupervised learning, with a particular emphasis on the mathematical formulation of algorithms, and the way they can be implemented and used in practice. We will therefore describe some necessary tools from optimization theory, and explain how to use them for machine learning. Numerical illustrations will be given for most of the studied methods.
We will follow the book from Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman called ""Elements of Statistical Learning"". This will define the structure of the course even if we will sometime complement the book during the lectures

Unique blend of data science and business
Jump start your research career
Small-scale setting
Successful graduates will continue in fully paid PhD positions
At present, accreditation for the research master in Business Data Science is pending. Until accreditation occurs, all courses will be hosted by Tinbergen Institute in a separate track. Students will enroll in the Tinbergen Institute research master program.

The specialization in Business Data Science is a two-year track consisting of 120 EC. It is tailored for recent Bachelor’s degree graduates, or those currently still enrolled in an undergraduate degree program, who are looking to pursue a solid course of training leading to a doctoral degree.


 
Year 1: Acquiring skills
In year 1, the primary objective is to build a solid data science foundation and expose students to a variety of methodological approaches. These skills are applied to various business disciplines in the field courses.

Year 2: Building knowledge
In year 2, students focus on a given business sub-discipline, selecting from among: 1) finance, 2) entrepreneurship and innovation, 3) marketing science, 4) human resources and organization, 5) logistics and supply chain. The courses assigned for each of these sub-disciplines have been carefully selected by a team of experts with the aim of ensuring the perfect learning trajectory that will lead to substantive contributions in the fields of each particular sub-discipline.

Aligning skills and knowledge
The curriculum starts with an overview of the business problems that data science can address (in block 0), which also exposes students to fundamental components of the five business fields. This early exposure helps students to absorb and process materials presented later in courses on methodology, with respect to the various business perspectives. Students become further acquainted with the five business fields during seminars held throughout the first year, as well as during the research hackathon. This event makes students think about how to approach the problems that arise in the various disciplines, and puts their knowledge to the test.

First year students will address problems in all five business fields; second year students will focus on addressing the problems linked to their field of specialization. The research clinic and the Research Master thesis represent students’ final moments of integrating business and data science, and will showcase their ability to identify relevant problems and address them using cutting-edge techniques to make a substantive contribution to the field."

1) To learn about computational methods based on Darwinian principles of evolution.
2) To illustrate the usage of such methods as problem solvers and as simulation tools.
3) Togain hands-on experience in performing computational experiments with evolutionary algorithms.

The course is treating various algorithms based on the Darwinian evolution theory. Driven by natural selection (survival of the fittest), an evolution process is being emulated and solutions for a given problem are being ""bred"". During this course all ""dialects"" within evolutionary computing are treated (genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, evolutionary programming, genetic programming). Applications in optimisation, constraint handling, machine learning, and robotics are discussed. Specific subjects handled include: various genetic structures (representations), selection
techniques, sexual and asexual variation operators, (self-)adaptivity. Special attention is paid to methodological aspects, such as algorithm design and tuning. If time permits, subjects in Artificial Life will be handled.

Information retrieval studies and invents methods and techniques for the design, implementation, and use of information processing technology in the context of a variety of Internet applications, ranging from search engines to text analysis.

Information Retrieval has developed from a number of research areas, including Computer Science, Library Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, and Natural Language Processing. While Information Retrieval builds on techniques from a variety of research areas, there are a number of research problems that are specific to the Web applications, such as the design of Internet search engines, efficient linking of related information across the Web, improving information extraction from social networking sites, and the access of foreign language information. In addition, the sheer scale of the Internet opens up tremendous opportunities for data mining approaches, while at the same time posing interesting research challenges with respect to robustness and scalability.

Within the Information Retrieval profile you will be familiarized with several data mining, natural language processing, and link-based techniques that are not only relevant to this profile but also to many other Artificial Intelligence applications.

Netherlands,Universiteit van Amsterdam,MSc Artificial Intelligence,Knowledge Representation,"When humans reason about the world, we identify objects, we make categories of such objects, and we reason about the relations between the things in the world around us. How can we represent such knowledge in a computer, in such a way that a  computer could reason about the world around it in a similar way?

The field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning aims to represent knowledge in such a form that a computer system can use it to solve complex tasks such as diagnosing a medical condition or having an intelligent dialog in a natural language. Knowledge representat­­ion and reasoning uses logic as its main mathematical tool, and tries to answer such questions as: how can we design logics that can efficiently reason with very large amounts of knowledge? Which logics are suited for reasoning about space and time? How can we deal with uncertainty and vagueness? How to reason about changes in the world around us?

Knowledge Representation techniques are used in many practical applications. Examples are expert systems for medical diagnosis, decision support systems for judges, and intelligent dialogue systems such as Siri on the iPhone.­","The Master's programme in Amsterdam has a technical approach towards AI research.

Due to the increased availability of data from sensors (Internet-of-Things), the range of applications is growing fast. The emphasis in this profile is on algorithms and statistical models that explain why and when algorithms work. We also discuss a number of algorithms in detail, such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, regression and classification, graphical models and deep learning.  The profile has a strong mathematical component, but there is also an emphasis on developing the skills to implement machine learning algorithms through project assignments. As a student in Machine Learning you can do your master's thesis on a fundamental topic. e.g. developing a new general algorithm, but also on a more applied topic, e.g. developing an innovative application. Many students conduct their thesis research as an intern with a company. ","The Master's programme in Amsterdam has a technical approach towards AI research.

Netherlands,Universiteit van Amsterdam,MSc Artificial Intelligence,Multi-Agent Systems,"A key goal of artificial intelligence is to develop agent systems that can make decisions and complete tasks without direct human supervision. Agent systems focuses on completing the perception-action loop: given the results of such perception, how should an agent act in order to reach its goal, maximise its utility, and minimise its costs? Autonomous robots are a prototypical example of such systems, though an agent system can also be computer that plays board games like chess and go, or a search engine that meets information needs and offers recommendations.

An interesting setting is that of multiple agents that collaborate and communicate to behave intelligently. This involves understanding each others goals and perceptions, and planning actions collaboratively. ","The Master's programme in Amsterdam has a technical approach towards AI research.

Course main content
The course is concerned with computational problems in massively parallel artificial neural network (ANN) architectures, which rely on distributed simple computational nodes and robust learning algorithms that iteratively adjust the connections between the nodes heavily using the available data samples. The learning rule and network architecture determine specific computational properties of the ANN. The course offers an opportunity to develop the conceptual and theoretical understanding of computational capabilities of ANNs starting from simpler systems and progressively studying more advanced architectures, and hence exploring the breadth of learning types – from strictly supervised to purely explorative unsupervised mode. The course content therefore includes among others multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), self-organising maps (SOMs), Boltzmann machines, Hopfield networks and state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) along with the corresponding learning algorithms. An important objective of the course is for the students to gain practical experience of selecting, developing, applying and validating suitable networks and algorithms to effectively address a broad class of regression, classification, temporal prediction, data modelling, explorative data analytics or clustering problems. Finally, the course provides revealing insights into the principles of generalisation capabilities of ANNs, which underlie their predictive power.
