"EU Internal Market Law","This course covers the core of substantive EU law, namely internal market law. More precisely, it deals with the four freedoms: free movement of goods, freedom of establishment, freedom to provide services and free movement of capital. It also covers citizenship and offers a brief introduction to EU competition law.      This course complements the basic course on EU law [LDROI1226], which focuses on EU institutions and deals with how legislation is produced as well as enforcement mechanisms of EU law.    This course focuses on the content of (some) EU rules. It is complementary with other courses that cover other aspects of EU substantive law such as free movement of (natural) persons [LDREU2205], EU competition law [LDREU2208] or Firms and antitrust [LDFIRM2207], EU consumer law [LDREU2207] or EU labour law [LDROP2143].","EU law [LDROI1226] or similar course covering institutional aspects of EU law and enforcement mechanisms.  	   	Contents  	1.       The internal market toolbox  	2.      Free movement of goods  	3.       Free movement of persons and services  	a.      Free movement of workers  	b.      Freedom of establishment  	c.       Freedom to provide services  	d.      European Citizenship  	4.      Free movement of capital  	5.      Brief introduction to competition law (art. 101 and 102 TFEU)  	The methods which characterise European legislation on one hand (harmonisation, mutual recognition, administrative cooperation) and case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the other (typical patterns of reasoning) will be emphasised throughout the course. ","This course covers the core of substantive EU law, namely internal market law.

This implies on the one hand questions of allocation of powers, both in their “vertical” dimension (between the European Union and its Member States) and in their “horizontal” dimension (between the instituitons of the Union). The course will also develop certain key subjects of substantive European Union law in their constitutional dimension (economic constituitonalism, citizenship, human rights, etc.).         In order to offer an analysis of these principles and their significance, the course will engage with two kinds of materials. On the one hand, these principles are analyzed thanks to concrete examples from the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and of certain national courts (eg the German constitutional court). On the other hand, the course will offers a theoretical framework allowing the interpretation of these jurisprudential developments. Students will also be confronted with multiple theoretical perspectives on these jurisprudential developments and their significance.

In particular, students need to have a grasp of relationship between EU and national legal orders, primacy and direct effect, effects of directives and regulations and proceedings before the Court of justice, in particular action for annulment. This course is not recommended for students with no prior exposure to EU law.","This course will be an opportunity to discover competition law from the point of view of firms. The focus will be on rules applicable to firms' conduct, not on State's conduct. We will focus on the strategies firms can develop in the face of antitrust rules. We will also see how a more realistic approach of firm's behaviour is progressively being incorporated in antitrust scholarship (behavioural antitrust).","At the end of this course, you will be able to explain (e.g. to an entrepreneur) the key rules and concepts of EU Competition law, such as relevant market, restriction of competition, abuse of a dominant position, taking into account the case law and soft law studied during the course.  	When presented with a hypothetical set of facts, you should be able to i) identify whether EU competition rules apply, ii) if so, which substantive and procedural rules apply, iii) determine which authorities would be in charge of the matter and iv) outline the main steps of the reasoning to be conducted.You will be able to consider substantive and procedural issues both from the point of view of undertakings and from that of enforcement authorities.  	You will be able to research European courts case law and Commission decisions.You will be able to discuss certain competition law rules in light of empirical analyses of firm behaviour, based on scholarship you will have studied during the semester.

The second part is focused on the modern theory of portfolio management:  - 	modelling investors' attitude in the face of risk and optimum allocation of wealth between the various financial assets, primarily the CAPM  - 	practical aspects of the use of the CAPM using the market model (or Sharpe one-factor model) and multi-factorial models (only those based on macroeconomic data),  - 	the determination of the risk premium required by investors in a balanced market is analysed in the third part. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) are also introduced,  - 	discussion of market efficiency and investor behaviour. New developments in the theory incorporating the dimension of investor behaviour are presented.  The fourth part focuses on the evaluation of basic financial assets in company financing; shares and bonds. The maximization principle (the value of a financial asset is equal to the hope of future cash flows set against the return expected by the investor) is applied to bonds and ordinary shares.  The fifth part is devoted to active portfolio management and the evaluation of portfolio performance. A distinction is made between the performance measure leading to a portfolio classification and the performance attribution which involves management control and which aims to identify the operating decisions which make it possible to carry out an excess return in relation to a benchmark.  The sixth and last part of this course introduces derivative financial instruments and their use in the management of investor-incurred risk. The organisation of these markets, the valuation of these instruments and the development of complex strategy are dealt with in advanced courses given in the third and fourth year.","Additionnal module in Management 	                                                     LGEST100P                                  5                                        -","Additionnal module in Management"

"Finance",NA,"Aims","This course is focused on the contribution of financial theory in decision-making processes during situations of uncertainty.  The decisions to be taken can be distinguished in terms of their short- or long-term duration. Long-term decisions include investment choices, financing choices and dividend policies. Short-term decisions related to treasury, client-supplier account and stock management.  Analysis will thus be restricted to maximisation of a company's value and more particularly maximisation of shareholders' wealth. Within this theoretical framework, the financial approach can provide precise answers that make it possible to structure the decision-making process. Limiting the theoretical framework in this way by no means indicates that the final decisions taken by companies should be limited to this single dimension without considering the interests of the numerous parties involved in the life of the company (shareholders, managers, employees, suppliers, etc.)  It is also recognised these days that businesses have a social responsibility and that their thinking needs to include an ethical dimension. However, the Finance course focuses only on the financial dimension of the decision-making process, whilst acknowledging that businesses are not guided simply by this one dimension.

"History of Economic Thought","This course focuses on the history of Macroeconomics from Wicksell and Keynes to contemporary authors. As such, it can be seen as a companion course to Advanced Macroeconomics I (LECON 2121), Advanced Macroeconomics II (LECON 2122), and Research Seminar I: Macroeconomics (LECON 2161). The aim is to complete the technical skills of graduate students with deeper knowledge of the origin and evolution of macroeconomic ideas over time.","Aims","It is supposed that graduate students have already had some general introduction to the history of economic theories. Therefore this course will rather deal with special topics to be studied in depth. Possible topics are: the evolution of the meaning of equilibrium in economic theory; evolving conceptions of rationality in economic theory; the history of macroeconomics; controversies over involuntary unemployment in economic theory., the history of welfare theory, etc.","This course belongs to the group of critical courses aiming at complementing the technical education offered to our master students with a more philosophical, methodological and historical reflection.

"Critical Analysis of Market Economies","This year, the topic of the course is 'Market economies and ecological issues'.  	We will start from the unprecedented ecological (and related social) crises humanity is currently experiencing. We will question the place and/or the role of the market within these crises, both as a key institution of contemporary economies, as the normative horizon of mainstream economic analysis, and as a tool to cope with environmental issues.  	Are markets liable to contribute to pollution mitigation? Is economics, whose main normative horizon is market, adequately tooled to tackle ecological problems? To what extent do the socio-ecological crises question the tenets of economics? Our aim, in this course, is to systematically assess the scope and limits of the market in environmental governance, both as a tool and as an analytical framework.  	At the end of the course, students will be able to critically assess the pros and cons of market solutions/visions related to environmental issues.","No prior knowledge of environmental economics is required. Understanding of the basics of microeconomic theory is useful, as well as awareness about contemporary environmental issues.","Ideally, an MA course such as this one should be modulable (at least in part) according to the instructor's inter-ests as well as the requests possibly emanating from students (provided they are expressed repeatedly and can be integrated into the long-term build-up of the teaching). The only constraints are that the course's approach be a truly critical one, i.e., that it give rise to genuinely contradictory conceptual debates, and that therefore it display as much as possible a plurality of viewpoints. A course centered exclusively on the results of standard theory is not admissible ; significant space ought to be devoted to alternative visions, Marxist in particular, as well as to an interdisciplinary opening in the direction of sociology and political theory. Here is a suggestion of themes that are considered compatible with these imperatives : - Are markets compatible with freedom ? - To what extent does capitalism further self-realization or, on the contrary, generate alienation ? - Is the capitalist labor market inherently exploitative ? - Is the allocation of resources through markets compatible with democracy ? - Is competition a fair mechanism ?","The aim of this course is to provide advanced economics students with a set of tools for criticial reflection on the positive as well as negative aspects of organizing economic life through market mechanisms and, more broadly, through a capitalist logic of accumulation'profit'competition. The term "" critical "" here means an attitude of reflexive distance allowing students to clarify for themselves their own normative position with re-spect to the market economy and to capitalism.

In its last part this course will explore the implications of heterogeneity and incomplete markets for monetary policy.     Aims: The aim of the course is to teach the students to apply the tools of quantitative macroeconomics with  particular focus on the effects of heterogeneity. The treatment of the economic problems is rigorous and the students will be required to master the numerical methods which are utilized to solve the models presented in class. Beyond the methodological side, the content of this course is motivated by the microeconomic data and the course itself discusses several interesting economic phenomena related to household decisions and their impact on the macroeconomy.","Aims","The following topics will be covered :  Part I: The overlapping generations approach to capital accumulation Competitive equilibria & Optimality  Policies: pensions, public debt, fiscal policy Education, altruism Part II: Infinite horizon models of economic growth Endogenous growth theory, an introduction Technological progress, the ""embodiment controversy"" and growth Schumpeterian models of economic growth and fluctuations","The aim of this course is to teach to the students how and when to use the building blocks of modern growth theory.

Beyond the methodological side, the content of this course is motivated by the microeconomic data and the course itself discusses several interesting economic phenomena related to household decisions and their impact on the macroeconomy.","Aims","The following topics will be covered :  Part I: The overlapping generations approach to capital accumulation Competitive equilibria & Optimality  Policies: pensions, public debt, fiscal policy Education, altruism Part II: Infinite horizon models of economic growth Endogenous growth theory, an introduction Technological progress, the ""embodiment controversy"" and growth Schumpeterian models of economic growth and fluctuations","The aim of this course is to teach to the students how and when to use the building blocks of modern growth theory. These are taken from two different approaches: the first one considers that agents have an infinite hori-zon. The second one analyzes the case of an economy in which agents have finite lives ( overlapping genera-tions models ).

In order to design these interventions clearly and efficiently and to evaluate their impact, it is necessary to discuss the way social welfare is defined. This course is about studying some schools of thought that have produced families of notions of social welfare. We will also study how these notions of social welfare can be used to evaluate contemporary social policies.","Students must be familiar with basic microeconomics concepts, such as preferences, budgets, market equilibrium, Pareto efficiency, and general equilibrium"," The main themes are :  1) How can we define resource equality when agents have different preferences ?  2) Can we justify competitive markets when efficiency is to be combined with norms of equity ?  3) How can we define equality of opportunity when agents have different needs and different talents ? 4) How can public intervention improve equality when the governments face information constraints     ","Whereas economics is mainly interested in efficiency, it is often the case that public intervention is inspired by different norms. One such major norm is that of social justice. There is no unique way to define justice, however, and there are implementation issues when one wishes to reach a more equitable allocation of resources.

"Economic Analysis Seminar III - UCL","Since the publication of the book ""Nudge"" by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, these nudges received a lot of attention from policy- and decision makers. They are widely applied by authorities all over the world, and make their way into the corporate culture in many countries. Nudges are attempts to influence decisions of individuals not by classic economic incentives (e.g. subsidizes for retirement saving, taxes on unhealthy products such as alcohol and cigarettes, discounts to attract consumers) or bans. Instead, nudges try to push people in a direction without changing their choices. For example, reporting calories in a restaurant menu can induce people to eat less fat food, changing default rules on retirement-savings decisions can induce people to save more, or reporting your exercising to friends can help people to do more sports. Similarly, telling households how much more energy they consume than their neighbors can significantly reduce their energy consumption and help fight climate change.  This seminar introduces the behavioral-economic concepts behind nudges, and introduces a powerful empirical tool that becomes increasingly relevant for policy evaluation - randomized control trials. These RCTs are frequently used to evaluate policies in general, but nudges in particular.","Aims","The teacher proposes an issue to be addressed by the students (for example, is the Walloon Marshall Plan effective?).

"Dynamical Methods in Economics","This course has four main sections. The first section concerns dynamic optimization in continuous time and it is closely related to growth theory. In this context, systems of differential equations, their stability and solution techniques, will be discussed in class.  The second section concerns discrete time models (both deterministic and stochastic) and is related to the theory of real business cycles. In the context of stochastic models notions of stability in linearized systems of difference equations with forward looking variables are introduced. The third section is devoted to dynamic programming and in particular to solving dynamic problems in economics with the Bellman equation. Finally, the last part of the course is devoted to simple search theoretic models of the labor market in discrete and continuous time.           Aims: The aim of this course is first to familiarize the students with the tools of dynamic optimization in economics and the methodologies needed to solve dynamic problems, and second to present applications of these tools and methodologies.

In particular numerical algorithms will be employed to solve systems of deterministic differential equations, linear systems of stochastic difference equations.

The lack of stability may give rise to irregular and even  strange dynamics, and the third part of the course  precisely develops the techniques al-lowing to detect such complex dynamics (bifurcation theory mainly).

"Advanced Econometrics II - Time Series Econometrics","The course aims to find models that explain dynamical observations in economics. It considers the model-based method and attempts to infer model parameters by iteratively fitting observations with theoretical predictions from trial models. To this aim, it provides a necessary introduction to the basic theory of the following three types series: discrete-time Markov chain, continuous-time Markov chain, and continuous-time and continuous-state Markov processes.    The structure of the course is given as follows (subject to change)    1. Numerical methods    2. Stochastic numerical methods    3. Markov chains    4. Branching process    5. Continuous-time Markov chains    6. Birth and death processes    7. Continuous time Markov processes    8. Diffusion processes    9. Stochastic differential equations    10. Applications: competition, epidemic, population and spatial models","Aims","The course must cover the important and essential  themes of the econometrics of time series analysis and their application in some fields of economics, like macroeconomics and finance.  The basic concepts of stationarity and ergodicity are taught in the prerequisite course.  The main themes for this course are those of linear time series models (autoregressive and moving average models), unit roots and cointegration. Both univariate and multivariate models must be taught.  For non linear time series models, a selection of topics has to be done mainly among ARCH models, Makov-switching models, and state-space models.  In all topics, the themes of model building, evaluation and prediction are included.","The purpose is to train the students in the tools and models useful for the econometric analysis of economic  time-series.

"Advanced Econometrics II - Microeconometrics","Contents: 1)	Introduction. The nature of panel data.  2)	Linear, static model for panel data. Estimating System of Equations by OLS and GLS. Modelling individual heterogeneity. Fixed effect, Random effect models. Specification test. First difference meth-ods. Random effect with correlated unobserved effect. The approach of Mundlak and Chamberlain. The GMM approach (Haussman and Taylor types of estimator)  3)	Linear, dynamic model for panel data. The  bias of usual estimators. Estimator of Anderson-Hsiao, estimator of Arellano-Bond, estimator of Blundell-Bond. 4)	Discrete panel data. Refreshing on multiple response model. Random effect models for a binary de-pendent variable.Fixed effect models. Incidental parameter problem. 5)	Limited dependent variable and selection models. Truncated/censored data. Tobit I, II and III models. Attrition and selection bias. Random effect Tobit model. Fixed effect in truncated regression","Aims","The course proposes an up-to-date presentation of methods to model, analyse and test continuous, discrete and partially observed (censored or truncated) cross section and panel data models.  For panel data models, both static and dynamic approaches are considered. The course includes an introduction to the treatment of sample selection and attrition. If time permits, some variable open topics such as multinomial and ordered response models, semi-parametric approaches to static models and non-stationary panels can be included in the course according. 	Econometric modelling and statistical inference are presented at an advanced level. The course also includes an introduction to an econometric software (such as Stata®), which is used to illustrate all methods through applications.","This course focuses on the analysis of cross section and panel data. Cross section data refer to a large number of sample units (individuals, firms, ...) at a given instant of time. Panel data refer to the repeated observation of sample units over time. In this course we limit the analysis to panels with a large number of sample units that are followed over a limited number of time periods.  The objective of the course is to give the student a firm understanding of the workings of certain methods and a background for developing new methods. In addition, students should learn to implement certain methods by running econometric software programmes on data sets coming from published work. As such, the course in-tends to provide the necessary background both for the applied researcher who wants to uncover some causal relationship between two variables and for the theoretical researcher aiming at the development of new estima-tion methods.

"Advanced Course in Economics V","This course offers a thorough overview of models of optimal fiscal/monetary policies and government debt management. The starting point is the analysis of Lucas and Stockey (1983)  of a complete financial market. Within this framework we will consider the theory’s implications for the optimal behavior of capital and labor taxation. We will also investigate how governments should issue debt and in what maturities in order to achieve fiscal solvency.    In its second part, this course will study policies under incomplete financial markets. The optimal behavior of taxes will be analyzed but also the role of monetary policy in stabilizing governments budgets will be discussed.    Finally the course will review recent advances in the field of government debt management under incomplete markets, including an analysis of data facts and the market microstructure.    .    Aims: The course is rigorous and relies heavily on using  dynamic optimization in microfounded economic models. We will resolve optimal policy problems mainly using Lagrangians but we  will  also consider  representations of these problems with the Bellman equation. This course also has a macro-finance component, which pertains to the pricing of securities in which governments issue debt. A rigorous treatment of asset pricing within the context of macroeconomic models will be presented. Finally, we will solve the models with the computer and so the course will discuss numerical algorithms, with particular emphasis on the so called parameterized expectations algorithm.","Aims",NA,"Master [120] in Economics: Econometrics 	                                                     ETRI2M                                  5                                        -","Master [120] in Economics: Econometrics"

The course is organized around four major sub-themes: historical perspectives, theoretical approaches, actors, and policies.  	Historical perspectives on the AFSJ: overview of both the legal and political milestones and of the power dynamics at play in the construction of the AFSJ.  	Theoretical approaches to the study of the AFSJ: recap of classical theories of EU studies (neo-functionalism, inter-governmentalism, (post)integration theory, governance, Europeanization, neo-institutionalism), introduction to 'alternative' theoretical approaches (e.g. sociology of the EU, international political sociology, pragmatism, post-structuralism); and discussion of their theoretical use for the study of the AFSJ.  	The main actors of the AFSJ: recap of the main EU institutions (e.g. European Commission, European Parliament, Court of Justice, European Council and Council of the European Union) with a focus on their specific roles and competences related to the AFSJ. Presentation of AFSJ-related institutional actors: EUROPOL, EUROJUST, the European Data Protection Supervisor, CEPOL, FRONTEX, etc.; and brief overview of non-institutional actors (e.g. private actors, interest groups, NGOs') and of key international players.  	The main policies of the AFSJ: introduction to the key AFSJ policy fields: asylum, immigration, management of external borders, judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, police cooperation, personal data protection. Focus on the diverse policy and regulatory tools at play in the AFSJ and their uses and limitation in defining and enforcing policy agenda. Finally, discussion of the external dimension of the AFSJ policies, and the role of non-European actors in influencing or challenging its policies.","The course has three main objectives:  	First, students will acquire a comprehensive knowledge of the main policies and actors at the core of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ). This will permit them to better understand on-going developments and stakes in a policy field that has come to the forefront of political and societal debates.  	Second, students will be able to put to use both classical and non-mainstream theoretical approaches to EU studies. They will be able to test the added-value of diverse theories to better understand the behaviour of, and the relations among, concerned actors.  	Third, students will learn how to read recent and on-going controversies concerning sensitive topics of European, national and global governance.

First, it aims to provide a general overview of the system(s) of fundamental rights protection in Europe. In this respect, the first part of the course will focus on the place and role of fundamental rights within both the Council of Europe and the European Union and will seek to unpack the interplay between the judicial bodies of these two international organizations in the field of human rights.  	Second, this course purports to introduce the students to the basic concepts and patterns of reasoning used in fundamental rights adjudication. The second part of the course will therefore analyse a number of key elements of the human rights' « toolkit », namely the concepts of direct effect and positive obligation, the proportionality test, and the margin of appreciation doctrine. It will also discuss the existence and desirability of  a hierarchy within the category of fundamental rights and of the creation of a (presumably lower) category of « fundamental principles ».  	A third goal of this course is to show the extent to which the rights and values inherent in the European legal order contribute to the shaping of the policies of the European Union. In that regard, the third part of this course will seek to demonstrate that, notably through the case-law of the European Court of Justice, human rights and values bear a strong influence on the functioning of the internal market, on the enforcement of competition law, on the development of the European citizenship and on the completion of an area of freedom, security and justice.  	Finally, it is expected that, through this course, the students will acquire a better perception of the mutually beneficial relationship between fundamental rights and Europe.  Whereas fundamental rights need Europe to develop and thrive, Europe needs fundamental rights to consolidate its unity and define its specificity. At the same time, it is hoped that the students will come to realise that the concepts of « fundamental rights » and of « Europe » are nothing more than intellectual constructs, the evolving products of the never-ending interaction of law, ethics and politics.

"International Negotiation","- Introduction (strengths and limits of negotiation) - Theoretical approaches of international negotiation : structural, strategic, processual, cultural, behavioural and integrative approaches - Case study Teaching Methodology : - Focus on theoretical and practical aspects of negotiation. The understanding of the theoretical variables essen-tially result from the case study and the simulation. - Based on interactions with students","Knowledge about Theories of International Negotiations, International Organisations and Geopolitics.","The theoretical frame allows the analysis of any international negotiation : the object of the negotiation, its con-text (international and national context, historical precedents, '), its stakes, the values that are underlined, the balance of power and the personalities of the negotiators. The case study tends to highlight the creative and technical aspects of negotiations at the end of international or intercommunity conflicts.","The aim of the course is to acquaint students with negotiation and mediation in the framework of conflict reso-lution. Attention is given to different theoretical approaches of international negotiation. At the end of the course, students should be able to stress and analyze the variables at the origin of the success or failure of international negotiations. In addition, students will have the opportunity to participate in a simulation and therefore derive the necessary skills to negotiate in an assertive and efficient manner.

"Analysis of contemporary Japanese society","This course aims to describe and situate the Japanese contemporary society in a global context, in focusing on several important moments of the country that can be observed from different points of view. The course intends to consider not only the well known historical facts as capitulation, the speedy economic developing period after the WWII, but also the more recent facts that can be understood as universal facts. For instance, the economic bubble bursting in 1990s and its results (i.e., the terrorism in Tokyo subway by an sect « Aum » in 1995), the most recent economic 	crisis in 2008, the absence of the people's confidence in today's politics, the problems of Nuclear energy and questioning on other potential energy sources, the lack of freedom of thought and communication (the 3 last topics are the consequences of the North-East Japan Earthquake in March 2011). 	The course respects a priori a chronology of these actual facts. However, certain intemporary aspects of the Japanese culture, like Japanese people's behavioral tendencies, the notions of ambiguity, of generosity and of politeness, are constantly mentioned, since these cultural features are indispensable to understand the Japanese Society in general.","/","An introduction to the principal aspects of contemporary Japanese society in the post-war period.

How to react firmly in the case of diverse crises like natural disaster (earthquake, tsunami and typhoon) or the facts caused by human (economic crises, unstable political situation, pollution); 	4. How to keep hope in the future of the country in a harmonious way (not denying the country, nor neglecting the other countries' reactions). 	 ","At the end of this course, the student will be able to understand and to explain adequately topics the Japenese contemporary society presents as its features and/or problems.

However, certain intemporary aspects of the Japanese culture, like Japanese people's behavioral tendencies, the notions of ambiguity, of generosity and of politeness, are constantly mentioned, since these cultural features are indispensable to understand the Japanese Society in general.","/","An introduction to the principal aspects of contemporary Japanese society in the post-war period. The course touches on the following themes: 	1. How to build a new national identity after the defeat of the WWII in political, economic and cultural contexts; 	2. How to impose as a high-developed country at an international stage and how to master the different problems due to its so fast developing strategy; 	3. How to react firmly in the case of diverse crises like natural disaster (earthquake, tsunami and typhoon) or the facts caused by human (economic crises, unstable political situation, pollution); 	4. How to keep hope in the future of the country in a harmonious way (not denying the country, nor neglecting the other countries' reactions). 	 ","At the end of this course, the student will be able to understand and to explain adequately topics the Japenese contemporary society presents as its features and/or problems. The student will also be able to deal with concerned subjects with a comparative point of vue, in distinguishing between European and Japanese issues.

"English literature : Reading Roads in American Literary Texts","In the American imagination, the road embodies ideals of freedom and the fascination with adventure and survival. It is associated with Route 66, the conquest of the West, social rebellion, and the pursuit of the American Dream.  	This course addresses the characteristics and development of the road trope via the analysis of several (excerpts from) novels (Salinger, Nabokov, Kerouac, among others), poems, songs and short stories written by American creative writers.  	What do protagonists ultimately discover at the end of the road or within the American wild landscape? How have contemporary fiction and film challenged the white male tradition of the road narrative? How have ethnic groups experienced the road?  	This course focuses on the road narrative as a genre (mixing travelogue, journey, Bildungsroman, and picaresque literature) offering insights into the national, historical and cultural American identity, which relies on dislocation, movement and landscape, and oscillates between the vision of a New Jerusalem and an apocalyptic struggle with natural powers. More specifically, the class starts with earlier road narratives and culminates with an examination of McCarthy's Pulitzer-prize winning novel The Road (2007) as an anti-road narrative in which the road has become, not a place of escape and freedom but an imprisoning body that is haunted by traumatic and apocalyptic visions of the future. While it highlights the spatialization that characterizes the American imagination as well as the postmodern anxieties reflected in the road trope, the course stresses important changes, from road to anti-road narrative, from road to highway and street narrative between conquest and celebration of the wilderness.","An introductory knowledge of English literature and a good proficiency in English (advanced level, B2 + in terms of the Common European reference framework)","The course traces the evolution of a particular theme in twentieth-century English literature.

"Gender and Sustainability in Utopian/Dystopian Literatures in English","""Although not everything we imagine may be achievable, what is never imagined cannot be achieved"" (Bill Ashroft)  This course analyzes a number of key dystopian and utopian texts to raise gender-related and sustainability issues and consider how gender roles and practices can contribute to sustainability in a posthuman world of climate change (Jeff Hearne 2014). Utopian thought has often been associated with naïve or static totalitarian models. However, while dystopian texts and films/series expose a new kind of political literature, which examines the dangerous possibilities inherent in the utopian project, other creative texts provide one with inspiring alternatives.  Through the comparative study of several utopian, dystopian, and ecotopian literary texts (including the works of Gilman, Huxley, Orwell, Ishiguro, Butler, Atwood, Waldman), we consider visions of better worlds in the way they emerge as frightening warnings or prioritize alternative modes for the future. The course has a chronological organization.  We begin with Thomas More and conclude with the series Black Mirror. Utopian thought is a crucial means of understanding the past, the anthropocene, and our transcultural future as regards questions of gender, social, cultural and political organization.  Starting with definitions of sustainability and gender studies, this course considers the ways in which the contemporary and the posthuman can be explored in an imagined ustopian future that addresses the major components of human-nature relations, ways of life and social structures suggested by these literary texts. Through guided in-class and online discussion, readings and researched writing, and group assignments, students will attempt to imagine their own viable utopias.","An introductory knowledge of English literature and a good proficiency in English (advanced level, B2 + in terms of the Common European reference framework).","This course offers a survey of contemporary literatures in English through the analysis of several representative works from distinct geographical/cultural areas. This course also includes the showing and discussion of adaptations for film and/or television.","- Students will be expected to show their ability to relate texts that illustrate one or more literary currents to the historical and literary contexts explored in the course. 	- They will have to produce an analysis that demonstrates their familiarity with the issues raised by the course, and with the poetics through which those issues are expressed. 	- The module is also indirectly meant to increase the students' lexical skills. Their analyses will therefore have to reflect a command of the English language that corresponds to their level (Masters), as well as a good grasp of the various cultural concepts discussed in the course.

Structure of the lexicon: semantic fields; paradigmatic relations (synonymy, hyponymy and antonymy) and syntagmatic relations. 	3. Phraseology: study of the different typologies and analysis of the criteria used to classify the various categories of multi-word units (compounds, collocations, idioms, etc.). 	4.

"Comics and the postcolonial","This course introduces students to the comics medium and encourages them to develop an understanding of comics and graphic novels through critical analysis and personal observation. First, it examines how comics work (linearity/tabularity), how to close-read the comics page and how certain elements relate to literary tropes. The second part of the class examines several comics with particular attention to (post)colonial aspects. After a historical, anthropological and sociological contextualization of the Congolese situation, and an introduction to postcolonial studies (Fanon, Césaire, Mudimbé, Mbembe, a.o.), we analyze how recent comics adaptations of Conrad’s famous Heart of Darkness address the colonial ghosts of Belgium’s past. Beyond studying the engagement of comics in issues of caricature, stereotype and representation, we discuss the processes of (de)fictionalization (short story, novel, graphic novel, reportage, non fiction, testimony) and ideologization at the core of these texts.

It covers the following topics: corpus design: 	- data collection, archiving and markup. 	- corpus typology: spoken and written corpora; monolingual vs multilingual; native vs learner; diachronic vs synchronic. 	- major electronic corpora: British National Corpus, International Corpus of English, International Corpus of Learner English, MICASE, Louvain International Database of Spoken English Interlanguage, etc. 	- corpus annotation (POS-tagging, lemmatization, parsing, semantic tagging, prosodic annotation, error tagging). 	- automated analysis of lexis, grammar and discourse.  	Special attention is paid to the links between corpus linguistics and foreign language learning, contrastive and translation studies and natural language processing.","By the end of the course, students are expected to have a solid theoretical background in corpus linguistics and master the main techniques and tools used to analyse spoken and written computerized data. They will be able to read the scientific literature and conduct their own research in the field.

Since then, the study of visual culture has not only become a widely accepted academic field but finds more and more its way into the debates of art history. If one wants to situate art within that broader context of visual culture the following issues have to be considered: - From a semiotic point of view, images - artistic or not - may be seen in relation to social practices and relations which construct their meanings. - In order to understand what regulates the meanings of images in modern societies, issues of reproducibility and technology have to be tackled as well as historical and institutional conditions. - Finally, drawing on the insight that meaning is not residing within the object but is constituted in the articulation between viewer and viewed, the cultural practices of looking and seeing must be taken into account. Thus, semiological, anthropological, and psychological approaches are indispensable for understanding visual practices and the image's capacity to convey meaning.

"Theories of Organizations in Management","Why do firms exist? And why markets and other arrangements among individual or collective actors exist? How can we explain the causes and consequences of interactions and collaborations between actors? How can we assess (and give sense to) performance evaluations (profit, efficiency, legitimacy...) at individual or organizational levels? Here are some of the core questions supporting a sizeable chunk of research works in management. To tackle seriously such issues, researchers need to develop intellectual frameworks that we call theories. Theories provide lens to analyse people actions and behaviors and to draw causal relations. Furthermore, theories create the common grammar that a community of researchers shares.    Albeit considered as a ""practice matters at first"" discipline, management also needs theories, not only to be accepted as an academic discipline, but also to create sound, replicative and cumulative knowledge. So far, theoretical approaches of organizations developed in management studies have been widely inspired by more old and established disciplines in social sciences – economics, psychology and sociology. More recently, researchers in management have developed efforts to create a more specific approach.    This course is an introduction to these theories of organizations widely used in the research field of management & organizations. We will review the main theoretical approaches through their disciplinary origin: economics (day 2), sociology (day 4) and psychology (day 5). We will also review the theories more “management based”: the competence approach (day 3) and the stakeholders approach (day 6). We will start by a brief introduction and an analysis of behavioural assumptions adopted in these social science theories.    The learning objectives are twofold. The very first learning objective will be focused on the basic features of each theoretical approach. We will help students (a) to acquire a helicopter’s view and a synthetic perspective on the different theories - useful knowledge to position your research on sound foundations (internal consistency); (b) to sort out concepts and frameworks and to be able to identify specific features of each theory and overlaps/contradictions between theories - other useful knowledge to position your research on sound foundations (external consistency). The second learning objective will be more oriented towards the development of a researcher’s skills. We will help students (a) to develop analytical reading skills – useful to manage huge volumes of articles; (b) to develop synthetic writing skills – useful to orchestrate discussion between papers and develop your own way.         The course is a PhD level course.                    Introduction to the theories of the firm  	Firms, markets and other organizations: theoretical foundations for a puzzle  	Behavioural assumptions: rationality and motivation  	Theoretical foundations 1: the coordination issue  	Theoretical foundations 2: the competence issue  	Theoretical foundations 3: the institutional issue  	Theoretical foundations 4: the network issue","None","This course will review the main theories in management that explain the existence of firms as specific institutions. The course includes both theories based upon the economic approach (agency; transaction cost approach and RBV) and theories based upon more sociological approaches (social interactions; institutional; networks). Emphasis will be put on how these theories explain the determinants of the size and scope of firms, or, in other words, on the main reasons why coordination of activities within a firm is preferred to coordination on a market.","On successful completion of this program, each student will acquire the following skills :  		Develop 		Communicate 	At the end of this course, the student will be able to :  	Undertand the different perspectives on organizations and to mobilize concepts in a sound rationale on managerial issues.

"Customer Relationship Management(CRM)","1.    The relational marketing approach: The traditional concepts of strategic and operational marketing will be revisited with a relational marketing approach. The growing influence of big data in this approach will be highlighted.  2.    Consumer-Brand Relations:  How can models of interpersonal relationships be applied to consumer brand relationships? The students will learn how to identify and leverage these different kinds of relations.  3.    Relational approach to business to business marketing: Business to business marketing is largely based on long term relations. Models will be presented in order to learn how to develop and implement customer-centric strategies and maximize their strategic value.  4.    Relational approach to service marketing: In the service marketing, the quality of the service is intrinsically related to the quality of the relation established with the customer. Models of service satisfaction and ways to maximize that satisfaction will be reviewed.","None","Relational marketing is taking more importance relative to transactional marketing. Companies try to tie up narrow contacts and to create long-lasting relations online and offline with their customers given the potential beneficial effect of these long-lasting relations on the profits of companies. This relational approach is particularly relevant (but no limited) to services marketing and business to business marketing. This course will present the theories and models of customer relationship management and apply them through case studies.","During their programme, students of the LSM Master's in management or Master's in Business engineering will have developed the following capabilities'   	2.1 Master the core knowledge of each area of management.  	2.4 Activate and apply the acquired knowledge accordingly to solve a problem.  	3.1 Conduct a clear, structured, analytical reasoning by applying, and eventually adapting, scientifically based conceptual frameworks and models,to define and analyze a problem.  	8.1 Express a clear and structured message, both orally and in writing in their mother tongue, in English and ideally, in a third language, adapted to the audience and using context specific communication standards.

"Ethical and Sustainable Consumption","1.    Consumer sovereignty and sustainable consumption: What are the different types of sustainable consumption patterns (e.g., buying fair-trade, buying green, but also sharing, recycling, re-using; we can also debates on simplicity, sufficiency and de-growth)? Who are the sustainable consumers? What are consumers' attitudes and behaviors toward consumption and sustainability? Which potential drivers might motivate consumers to use their buying power as a sort of ""vote"" for more responsible alternatives? What potential barriers might prevent consumers from acting more responsibly?  2.    Ethical issues related to marketing and consumption: We will debate on the ethical critiques of consumerism, as well as some common ethical issues related to marketing and consumption (e.g., impact of consumption decisions on the economy and the environment, privacy issues in the interconnected world, digital property, deceit, outright lies, or manipulation).  3.    The growth of consumer activism: In this digital world, more than ever before, consumer movements challenge social order and transform it through the propagation of ideologies of consumption in hope of changing mainstream practices. Consumer activism tactics include boycotts, 'buycotts', petitioning the government, media activism, and organizing interest groups.  4.   Sustainable consumption in practice: we will explore the diverse strategies to foster sustainable consumption from creating new sustainable business models with the product-service system economy to downsizing and low-impact lifestyles or grassroots innovations. These new patterns of consumption will be studied through specific fields and case studies: food, waste, energy, finance, and housing.","None","This course is designed to increase awareness and provide tools for analyzing ethics, beliefs and attitudes related to marketing and consumption, and how they relate to issues of sustainability. One of the major causes of the deterioration of the global environment is the unsustainable pattern of consumption and production, particularly in industrialized countries. Beyond the necessity to promote efficiency in production processes there is a need to shift to more sustainable patterns of consumption (e.g., environmentally-friendly behaviors, local products consumption, voluntary simplicity, de-growth). In this context, this course addresses the question of consumer social responsibility in the transformation process towards more sustainable consumption-production-patterns from an environmental and social justice perspective. Moreover, based on some non-ethical practices quite frequently observed in practice, we will discuss the growth of consumer activism as well as the design and implementation of a sustainable marketing approach.","   	 		During their programme, students of the LSM Master's in management or Master's in Business engineering will have developed the following capabilities' 	 		1.1 Demonstrate independent reasoning,look critically and consciously acquired knowledge (both academic and common sense) and managerial practices, in light of emerging circumstances and their outcomes 	 		1.2Decide and act by incorporating ethical and humanistic values, integrity, respect for the laws and conventions, solidarity and civic action, and sustainable development. 	 		1.3Decide and act responsibly,  while taking into account the social, economic and environmental sometimes antinomic, outcomes in the short, medium and long term, for the various stakeholders$ 	 		2.2 Master highly specific knowledge in one or two areas of management : advanced and current research-based knowledge and methods. 	 		3.3 Consider problems using a systemic and holistic approach : recognize the different aspects of the situation and their interactions in a dynamic process.

"Tools for Supply Chain Management Decisions (in English)","The course starts with an in depth revision of the revised simplex algorithm, because it provides the computational and modeling paradigm allowing one to model and solve (sometimes using so-called decomposition methods) large scale models involving many variables. In particular, the column generation approach, which is frequently used in solving large scale problems by decomposition, is illustrated on the cutting stock problem, a classical production planning problem. Production planning are approached from a practical computational perspective. Formulated as MIP problem, they can be very difficult to solve and thereby require to maintain a certain level of aggregation. Branch and bound improvement techniques such as constraint (Branch and cut) and column (Branch and price) generation are considered. Content STRUCTURAL ASPECTS AND METHODS. Convexity. Minkowski polyhedral representation. Duality. From linear programming to convex programming. The revised simplex algorithm as a computational paradigm. Complexity of algorithms. Mixed integer programming. CUTTING STOCK AND BIN PACKING PROBLEMS. Coping with the combinatorial explosion of patterns. Column generation techniques and the related knapsack problem. Extensions of the cutting stock problem. . DECOMPOSITION APPROACHES AND DECENTRALIZATION. Handling the multidivisional model by a decomposition approach : solving repeatedly a series of divisional problems and a coordination one (the decomposition approach).

"Cross Cultural Competences and Management for CEMS","The following themes are examples of what will be addressed in this course:  	-           Understanding and analysing cultural differences and the impact of culture on organizations, teams, individuals  	-           Culture learning and (self-)development of cross-cultural competence and of a 'global mindset'  	-           Working in multicultural teams 	-            Communicating effectively across cultures  	-           Expatriate assignments: living and working abroad 	-            Female global managers  	-           Diversity and organizational culture  	-           Acting responsibly in the global arena","Aims","Working with people for other cultural backgrounds has become part of the daily activities in organizations today for employees at all levels. The global pressure for competitiveness and effectiveness has increased the number of strategic alliances, mergers and acquisitions, with the objective of having access to resources, capital and new market opportunities. The travelling distance of managers has increased i.e. even short trips can be from one continent to another. People who have never met each other need to work together in multicultural virtual teams.  	It is no longer sufficient, that managers are able to communicate effectively and work with people from one culture and that they understand and learn how to adapt to this particular culture. Instead, managers must interact simultaneously and effectively with people in multiple cultures or with a poly-cultural background.  	This course is based on research and insights from diverse disciplines, including cross-cultural psychology, social psychology, cultural anthropology, organizational behaviour, international human resource management, business ethics and global responsible leadership.","During their programme, students of the LSM Master's in management or Master's in Business engineering will have developed the following capabilities'  	2.4 Activate and apply the acquired knowledge accordingly to solve a problem  	5.1 Understand the inner workings of an organization : develop a global approach and integrate the internal logic used within the organization.  	6.1 Work in a team :Join in and collaborate with team members.

"Sustainable Management and Value Chains","In the 21st century, a company cannot maintain its competitive position or achieve continuous operating improvement without the successful implementation of strategic, well-designed, and well-implemented sustainability initiatives. Sustainability improvements are critical at many points in an operation's value chain, from initial product conception to production/manufacturing, distribution, and waste disposal.    A sustainable, socially responsible, and financially-driven company must develop, analyze, select, and implement measures that will help it capitalize on the opportunities for improved operating performance, and that will mitigate the inevitable unfavorable effects of business operations. This requires managers who can identify potential threats and challenges, develop strategies to address such challenges, conduct the evaluations of competing alternatives, and make the fact-based decisions. It also requires managers to articulate the decisions to broad sets of stakeholders (i.e., the facility manager, the chairman of the board, individual employees, community organizations, governmental/regulatory agencies).","Aims","This course will address environmental, social and ethical risks, and new business opportunities arising from managing the natural environment.

"Finance and Responsible Investment Practices","I. Course overview    	Socially responsible investment (SRI) represent a growing part of assets under management. Research has shown that asset managers incorporate ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues in their decision-making processes. Asset owners such as pension funds, wealthy private investors and more generally retail investors increasingly demand sustainable finance products from their banks.      	     	Despite this growing demand and research evidencing the positive return of socially responsible investment, financial institutions still need to overcome many challenges, beliefs and paradoxes linked to SRI. Not only do they have to gather and interpret material data to guide their investment decisions, combining quantitative and qualitative data, they also need to select appropriate measures to assess the impact of their investment decisions.    	     	This course provides students with methods and tools to guide sustainable investment decisions, taking into account the different challenges identified by literature and practitioners.

"Strategic Marketing","This course is organized around a strategic business game, in which groups of students (4 students on average - each group managing a virtual company), compete on one or two competitive markets, in order to maximize the value of their products for their customers and the company value. The course underlines strategic marketing aspects of company management. The business game is far from being an end in itself: it helps as an exploration field, in order to go deeper in theoretical concepts studied by students in previous classes of Strategic Marketing and Market Studies, and put them in perspective with the situation of their virtual company.    After a session devoted to an introduction to the business game Markstrat, each group acts as a company active in a specific industry, in order to maximize the value of products for customers and the value of the company for shareholders. During each session, students present the evolution of the strategy of their company, argue for their choice (depending on the changing competitive environment), and state their strategy on an operational level. Feedback is given during each session on the decisions made during previous sessions, and on the theoretical concepts used by students. Theoretical points are underlined by the teacher at the beginning of sessions, and also after sessions, through a system of inverted classes (videos, tutorials, etc).    Learning outcomes    At the end of the class, students will be able to:    - analyze the potential strategic options for a company/organization, especially linked on its positioning on a market and the customer market segmentation;    - build the most adequate strategy for a company/organization, by referring to theoretical concepts;    - understand the steps of a (external and internal) thorough strategic marketing analysis;    - master frequent and advanced marketing studies, and connect the results provided by these studies;    - point out and focus on pieces of information that enrich their thoughts and allow them to reach their goal, while they get overwhelmed by information;    - reconcile the different points of view expressed by the members of the team;    - anticipate and organize their work, under pressure of time;    - summarize their thoughts in a clear way, provide arguments for each choice, and communicate them in an efficient way, verbally as well as in written reports.    - Evaluate and appreciate the relevance of their choices, a posteriori.","/",NA,"Master [120] in Management 	                                                     GESM2M                                  5                                        -","Master [120] in Management"

Second, the characteristics of the learner at work at different professional stages are outlined: in the beginning and in the second half of the career. We will center on understanding the role of motivation in how adults learn and acquire expertise in a professional domain. Next, we discover why the workplace environment plays a major role in professional learning and development of workers. We will identify job characteristics that enhance or hinder learning and the different aspects of a powerful organizational learning climate. At last, various ways to facilitate formal and informal learning and development at work are discussed and illustrated (practices and tools).  				  	 ","Aims","New perspective on professional learning and development: trends  	Formal and informal learning at work  	Characteristics of the learners at work: Motivation in adult learners  	Characteristics of the learning work environment: Workplace affordances and Organizational learning climate  	Supporting professional learning and development at work","A1. control knowledge about explaining and understanding of  an individual, a group or an organization;  	A2. analyze, criticize in a argued way and model a situation (individual, group or organization) in reference to theories, research results, methods and tools related to psychology.

"Integrated project in information management","Each year, a different real-world and topical problem will be presented to the students. This presentation may involve various stakeholders. In order to mimic a real engineering office, the students will organize themselves into groups that are composed of 2 to 4 students. They will summarize the problem and plan the work to be done (steps and milestones, external resources to be used, deadlines to honor) in order to achieve a scientifically sound and realistic solution. Depending on the problem at hand, the work will include at least two priority tasks among the following list (other tasks are thus considered as subordinated) : data collection, data validation & correction,  management of the corresponding databases, statistical analyses and modeling, risk analysis about the project outcomes and proposed solution, written and oral communication towards stakeholders and scientists that are non-specialists, assistance for a proper diffusion of the results (indicators, computer interfaces, etc.).  	The students will have to report the intermediate outcomes of the project at key steps. A joint written report must be delivered by the end of the semester. This report will be orally presented during the examination session.","This project is open to any bioengineer master student (A, C, E or F) upon prior completion of the bachelor cycle                            The prerequisite(s) for this Teaching Unit (Unité d’enseignement – UE)                for the programmes/courses that offer this Teaching Unit are specified at the end of this sheet.","The integrated project in Technologies and management of information requires the students to mobilize their knowledge and skills in an integrated and transverse way whatever their specific master.

"Physiological and nutritional biochemistry","1.    Table of contents :  	The course is composed of six complementary parts: 	A. Digestion and absorption (6h)  	B. Regulation of the intermediary metabolism (12h)  	C. Biochemistry of the lactation process (6h)  	D. Requirements in the major nutrients (7h)  	E. Requirements in vitamins and minerals (7h)  	F. Relationship between alimentation and health (11h)  	2.    Explications complémentaires (si nécessaire)  	The last part of the course includes lectures given by senior scientists specialized in the field(in the framework of symposia or upon specific invitation).  	The course starts with a detailed study of the physiology of digestion and absorption, followed by a synthetic summary of the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and protides. It continues with the relationships between nutrition and metabolism through several examples of specific metabolic situations, such as fasting, lactating or suffering from diabetes. The course then presents the nutritional requirements of humans together with the corresponding recommended daily allowance, in terms of energy, nitrogen, amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, water, minerals and dietary fibre, with, in each case, a special focus on the biochemical justification of the needs.

This risk management is an integral part of the professional life of the geotechnical engineer. It implies to be able to identify the risks, to quantify them and to mitigate their impact. The proposed learning is acquired by illustrating the ""risk"" aspects of different geotechnical problems already solved within the mandatory geotechnical curriculum, as well as by introducing new problems where the risk pertains to the project demands and to particular behaviors of soils.  	The course is divided into two parts:  		The first part starts with the definition of risk and the concept of acceptable risk. Then, it moves on to the methods used to represent the risks and guide the decision-making process. The risks relating to the different phases of a geotechnical engineering project are discussed. These are intrinsically linked to the uncertainties belonging to soil mechanics, namely the uncertainty of characterization resulting from the natural variability of the soil and of the limits of the means of investigation, the uncertainty of calculation resulting from the limitations of the calculation available models, the uncertainty of loading, particularly important in the case of natural loading (for example, earthquakes) and finally the uncertainty of achievement due to the difficulty of underground construction processes. 		The second part deals with a series of practical cases that will help implement the concepts acquired in the first part. For example, the risks related to the slope stability, and the risks related to offshore constructions that will be treated according to the preferences of the students.","With respect to the learning outcomes repository of the program ""Master in Civil Engineering"", this course contributes to the development, acquisition and the evaluation of the achievements of the following LOs:  	AA1.1, AA1.2, AA1.3, AA2.1, AA2.2, AA2.3, AA2.4, AA2.5, AA3.1, AA4.1, AA4.2, AA5.1, AA5.2, AA5.3, AA5.4, AA5.5, AA5.6, AA6.1, AA6.3  		Demonstrate the mastery of a body of knowledge in the basic, disciplinary, and polytechnical sciences, allowing one to solve arising problems 		Organize, fulfill, and validate an approach of engineering aimed at responding to a need or a specific problem 		Document and summarize the state of knowledge in a limited area 		Communicate the results of one's work in the form of reports, plans, presentations, or other documents tailored to one's audience 		Act with professionalism and rigor, while integrating the issues and ethical choices in the exercise of one's responsibilities 		More specifically, at the end of this course, the student should be able to: 	Technical skills and engineering:  		Understand and quantify the uncertainties of soil characterization and integrate these uncertainties in a risk  based geotechnical design process 		Assess the importance of the consequences arising from imperfections in the actual construction of elements of civil engineering works with regards to their stability 		Understand the importance of the responsibility of the Geotechnical Engineer in legal and contractual contexts.

"Software engineering project","For a long time, general-purpose CPUs focused on supporting efficiently a single thread of execution. Improvements in chip manufacturing allowed packing more transistors on the same surface of a silicon wafer, and run resulting CPUs at higher frequencies. Single-threaded applications would simply run faster with every new processor generation. This era is now over. The industry hit several limitations known as the power wall, the memory wall and the ILP wall. No longer able to vertically scale-up CPUs supporting a single thread of execution, chip manufacturers have started packing together multiple, simpler units of execution, or cores. Exploiting the power of multiple cores requires exploiting parallelism in applications using multiple threads. Writing concurrent code requires identifying and managing concurrency, and introducing the necessary synchronization for correctness. Writing scalable and performant concurrent code requires understanding this tradeoff between synchronization and parallelism and mastering efficient implementations of shared data structures and algorithms for concurrent execution. Finally, multicore CPUs employ a complex memory layout, and the assumption of uniform memory access times is no longer valid. Understanding the impact of non-uniform memory accesses (NUMA) is therefore important to write efficient code for multicore CPUs.  	   	This course will provide students with the necessary tools and knowledge to write efficient and scalable code for modern multicore CPUs. It will detail the mechanisms available for synchronization, starting from the implementation of language constructs such as locks, monitors or condition variables, to the direct uses of CPU-provided synchronization primitives (e.g. compare-and-swap) to build efficient and scalable data structures. It will emphasize the performance aspects of multicore programming: the impact of synchronization primitives, the impact of non-uniform memory access, and the impact of multiple-level memory hierarchies. It will finally offer an opening to the future of multicore programming with an introduction to transactional memory and to the support for speculative execution in modern CPUs (e.g. Intel Haswell), and discuss the execution model for concurrent code running on GPUs.  	 &amp;lt;!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face 	{font-family:""Cambria Math"";

"Software engineering project","For a long time, general-purpose CPUs focused on supporting efficiently a single thread of execution. Improvements in chip manufacturing allowed packing more transistors on the same surface of a silicon wafer, and run resulting CPUs at higher frequencies. Single-threaded applications would simply run faster with every new processor generation. This era is now over. The industry hit several limitations known as the power wall, the memory wall and the ILP wall. No longer able to vertically scale-up CPUs supporting a single thread of execution, chip manufacturers have started packing together multiple, simpler units of execution, or cores. Exploiting the power of multiple cores requires exploiting parallelism in applications using multiple threads. Writing concurrent code requires identifying and managing concurrency, and introducing the necessary synchronization for correctness. Writing scalable and performant concurrent code requires understanding this tradeoff between synchronization and parallelism and mastering efficient implementations of shared data structures and algorithms for concurrent execution. Finally, multicore CPUs employ a complex memory layout, and the assumption of uniform memory access times is no longer valid. Understanding the impact of non-uniform memory accesses (NUMA) is therefore important to write efficient code for multicore CPUs.  	   	This course will provide students with the necessary tools and knowledge to write efficient and scalable code for modern multicore CPUs. It will detail the mechanisms available for synchronization, starting from the implementation of language constructs such as locks, monitors or condition variables, to the direct uses of CPU-provided synchronization primitives (e.g. compare-and-swap) to build efficient and scalable data structures. It will emphasize the performance aspects of multicore programming: the impact of synchronization primitives, the impact of non-uniform memory access, and the impact of multiple-level memory hierarchies. It will finally offer an opening to the future of multicore programming with an introduction to transactional memory and to the support for speculative execution in modern CPUs (e.g. Intel Haswell), and discuss the execution model for concurrent code running on GPUs.  	 &amp;lt;!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face 	{font-family:""Cambria Math"";

"Mining Patterns in Data","Frequent itemset mining: algorithms, data structures; 		Constraint-based itemset mining: algorithms, data structures; 		Patterns in sequences, trees, graphs: algorithms, data structures, complexity classes; 		Pattern mining in supervised data: scoring functions, algorithms; 		Pattern set mining in supervised data: scoring functions, models (decision trees, boosting), algorithms 		Pattern set mining in unsupervised data: scoring functions (minimum description length principle, maximum entropy), algorithms 		Applications of pattern mining: software repositories, traces, log files, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, industrial applications","Aims","An important task in data mining is the discovery of patterns in data. Patterns are recurring structures in data; they can provide interpretable explanations for observations in data, can help to gain a better understanding in the structure of data, can be used to build better models, and can be used to solve other computational tasks (such as the construction of database indexes or data compression). Patterns can be found in many different forms of data, including data from supermarkets, insurance companies, scientific experiments, social networks, software projects, and so on.

"Physics of Functional Materials","The first part presents the various types of materials and their classification with respect to their function. Particular attention is given to their use in the industry and in every-day life. The symmetry of the properties is discussed. A thermodynamic approach is introduced in order to distinguishing between direct and coupling properties. The microscopic origin of direct properties is discussed allowing to study the basics of magnetic (dia-, para-, ferro-, ferri-, et antiferro-magnetism) et dielectric (polar dielectrics, ferroelectricity) materials.  	The second part deals with superconducting materials. After a review of the historical background, the most important experimental facts and materials are presented. The theoretical  framework is briefly sketched (London, BCS, Ginsburg-Landau) emphasizing the consequences. The use of superconductors is discussed for power transmission and high magnetic fields production. The notions of critical current and magnetic field and vortex lattices are introduced. The current/voltage characteristics of a superconducting junctions are described (Josephson effects), presenting practical applications such very sensitive detectors (SQUID) and high-frequency devices.  	The third part is devoted to optical materials with every-day-life applications. Absorption, emission, and propagation phenomena in condensed-matter are studied in detail. The theory is illustrated by analyzing various typical cases chosen among electroluminescent diodes (including their LASER irradiation), propagation and amplification in systems based on optical fibers, photovoltaic cells, LASER based on gemstones.","Aims","The course covers in three themes.

"Numerical Geometry","Computational Geometry is a relatively new field concerned with designing algorithms and computer programs to perform geometric computations. A need for such computations arises in many fields: computer graphics, robotics, pattern recognition, geography, manufacturing, and so on. An example is the following problem that arises in medical imaging. From a CAT or MRI scan, slices through a three-dimensional object are obtained, perhaps a brain tumor. From these slices the object must be ""reconstructed."" The basic step of this reconstruction is connecting two polygons lying in parallel planes. The connection is effected by finding a collection of triangles that span the two planes, have their corners at vertices of the polygons, and fit together seamlessly to form a closed polyhedron.

This includes our own environment, where they have to interact with us, humans. Biorobotics investigates the applications where robots cross the boundaries with life sciences, either because of their intrinsic design (in which case robots are said to be 'bio-inspired'), or due to the physical and/or cognitive proximity they have with humans. This includes medical applications: nowadays, robots are routinely used in surgical theatres and rehab facilities.  	This course covers some of the most recent developments in biorobotics.

"Evolutionary applications",NA,"Aims","The famous quote of Theodosius Dobzhansky ' « Nothing makes sense in biology, except in the light of evolution » (referring to his essay published in 1973) is well known among students in biology. However, the significance of evolutionary thinking is by no means limited to pure biology. Evolution played no significant role in psychology, sociology, agriculture, natural resource management and medicine for the better part of a century or so. But the intellectual times are changing. There are now new handbooks on evolutionary psychology, evolutionary medicine, Darwinian agriculture, etc. 'Evolutionary Applications' is also the title of a young scientific journal. Hence, students who are well trained in evolutionary thinking should be well armed for making significant contributions to several applied fields that are highly relevant for our society and current and future environment.  	In this course we will train evolutionary thinking within the context of several applications covering fields including agriculture, aquaculture, biomedicine, climate change, conservation biology, disease biology, forestry, invasion biology, fisheries, wildlife management, psychology and sociology. There is no syllabus or textbook, but we will use a number of papers and book chapters as study material (will be available on Moodle). I will lecture about different concepts and their application, and we will frequently discuss about case studies in the different fields of the natural and human sciences.","1.     Démontrer une maîtrise des processus de l'évolution des êtres vivants à long et court terme.  	2.     Se confronter à l'application des connaissances acquises en biologie évolutive dans une série de domaines en biologie et en dehors de la biologie dans le sens strict.

The photophysics, that is to say the evolution of excited states without considering reaction partners are then considered: possible decay (radiative or non radiative) of the energetic excess and Jablonski diagrammes.  The intermolecular processes are then considered: excimeres, exciplexes and extinction of excited states through energy transfer reactions, electron or proton transfer reactions, and use of these processes in sensitization.  The Marcus theory is also presented. The use of fluorescence, the Stern-Volmer approach as well as basics of fluorescence quantum yield are explained in view of helping to elucidate mechanisms.

A good knowledge of linear regression models (LSTAT2120 Linear models) is an asset.","This module aims to introduce recent developments in the field of statistical learning, applied to the insurance and financial sectors. Statistical methods are used in the insurance industry to assess the risk profile of an insured. This profile presents two sides: one is the frequency of claims and the other is the size of the claim caused by the insured. Both aspects are studied carefully by insurers so as to propose the best price for an insurance coverage. In the financial industry, advanced statistical methods are needed to evaluate the credit risk of a lender. As for an insurance contract, this risk has two sides. The first one is the probability that the lender will not repay is debt (the default risk). The second aspect is the size of the loss when the lender do not redeem is loan. This module present the common tools to study these risks: generalized linear models, additive models, Regression/classification trees. Some new aspects will also be developed among them we quote shrinkage methods (Lasso, Ridge) and random forests that reveals to be powerful tools to explore massive data.","At the end of this course, students will be able:  		To explain and motivate the choice of a statistical method to analyze insurance or financial data 		To use Generalized Linear and Additive models to propose a grid of insurance premium or to propose a model to evaluate the default risk of a counterparty 		To use Regression Tree and random forest on insurance or credit datasets.

On completion of this module, students should be able to: (i) understand the fundamentals of commonly used dating methods, (ii) interpret dates and rates of geomorphologic processes in terms of long-term landscape evolution, and (iii) read independently scientific literature on earth surface processes and evolution.","The main objective of this course is to acquire the key concepts in geomorphology as to understand dynamic landscape evolution. Geomorphic markers and several dating techniques will be discussed in detail, so that students get a thorough knowledge of quantitative geomorphology.          The contribution of this Teaching Unit to the development and          command of the skills and learning outcomes of the programme(s) can be          accessed at the end of this sheet, in the section entitled          “Programmes/courses offering this Teaching Unit”.","Master [120] in Geography : Climatology"
"Tectonic geomorphology","This course includes three parts :  (i) the presentation of geomorphologic concepts that govern the formation and evolution of the relief and the basics of dating techniques and morphologic markers   (ii) the autonomous application of these geomorphologic concepts through the analysis of topographic and morphometric indices calculated from digital elevation models in a GIS software   (iii) the analysis of the morphology of a landscape in the field through the application of concepts presented during lectures","Aims","The analysis of landscape morphology results from the study of internal and external processes that govern the formation and the evolution of relief. In the course, concepts of the dynamics and evolution of the relief are discussed through the analysis of tectonic, climatic and anthropic processes that have an influence on material transfer at the Earth surface.

Calculation techniques  	    - Heuristic derivation of QCD Feynman rules, and their application.  	    - Gluon polarization states and introduction of the Ghost fields.  	    - Color algebra (decomposition into partial amplitudes, computation rules for the color factors)  	    - Dimensional regularization  	   	3. Renormalization (UltraViolet regime)  	   	    - Structure of the divergences in the UV regime  	    - Renormalization of the fields, the strong coupling constant and the quark masses,  	      (MS-bar scheme vs OnShell scheme).  	    - QCD beta function and asymptotic freedom.  	    - Large log resummation via the evolution of the coupling constant.  	   	4. Factorization principles (InfraRed regime)  	   	     - Structure of divergences in the IR regime.  	     - Renormalization of the parton distribution function/ the fragmentation functions in the MS-bar scheme  	     - DGLAP evolution equation.     	     - Jet production.","Aims","This lecture is an introduction to Quantum ChromoDynamics (the theory of strong interactions). Only the perturbative aspects of the theory will be covered in the lecture. Students are assumed to be already familiar with the concept of quantum field theories and (ideally) its application to QED.  	The lecture introduces some calculation techniques for QCD (Feynman rules, color factors, sum over polarization states, ...) which are later used to explain several notions (factorization principles, renormalization, ...).  The emphasis is put on the physical interpretation of QCD rather than on the technical challenges behind the derivation of scattering amplitudes beyond the Born level. However,  techniques and notation adopted in the lecture are in close connection with the commonly-used framework in  p-QCD studies. In particular the choice of dimensional regularization is favored as opposed to other regularization schemes.  	   The objective of the lecture is two-fold.  	   a) To understand the theoretical notions underlying the cross section predictions for processes governed by the strong interactions. In particular, the lecture will clarify the concepts of fragmentation functions, parton distribution functions, factorization and renormalisation scales, large log resummation, ... to give students an access to a proper interpretation of theoretical results reported in the literature.  	   b) To acquire skills in QCD computation rules by means of explicit calculations (beyond the Born level).","Master [120] in Physics 	                                                     PHYS2M                                  5                                        -","Master [120] in Physics"

For the classical kernel density and regression estimator, the asymptotic theory will be developed in some detail. For time series regression and semiparametric models, an emphasis will be given on applications through various examples. Beyond understanding the properties, students are expected to learn how to implement the methods. 	1. Nonparametric estimation 	a. Kernel density estimator (properties, asymptotics, higher order kernels, density derivatives, 	multivariate densities, bandwidth selection) 	b. Nonparametric regression (local polynomial estimator, properties, asymptotics; time series) 	2. Semiparametric estimation 	a. Semiparametric eciency bounds 	b. Linear regression with unknown error density 	c. Partially linear model 	d. Single index model 	e. Semiparametric models for time series 	f.

"Nonparametric curve estimation : Fourier-based methods","1. Spectral density estimation: Definition, periodogram-based kernel estimators(properties, asymptotics, higher order kernels, multivariate spectral densities, bandwidth selection, time-varying 	spectral densities), interpretations. 	2. Projection-based estimators: General definition, specific wavelet approach (properties and asymptotics, mainly via simple Haar basis estimators), comparison of linear and non-linear methods (link 	to kernel estimation, overview on dierent thresholding methods), examples.","Aims","The objective of this lecture is to develop applications of non-parametric curve estimation methods to two modern fields of statistics: for the one, to the estimation of spectral densities of time series, including multivariate time series, for the other the interpretation of projection-based estimators as (linear and non-linear) smoothers in a general regression or density estimation context.","Students will be able to understand and appreciate finite sample and asymptotic properties of modern curve estimation methods, along the problem of estimating spectral densities of time series (an alternative and compact way to describe the correlation structure in a given time series in an enhanced and interpretable way). 	For projection based estimators (e.g. wavelet estimators), the emphasis will be on understanding the link to classical kernel estimation and why non-linear (threshold) based projection estimators can oer interesting 	advantages, both in theory and practice. Beyond developing the theoretical background, the numerical performance of the studied methods will be analysed by the students along a practical project (in R or matlab). Hence, having followed this course, the students will have seen all facets of the methodology on nonparametric curve estimation in two more advanced set-ups for which a deeper understanding of the 	concepts behind should enable them to correctly apply the shown methods and interpret their results in a concrete data situation.
